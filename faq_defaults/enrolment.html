For example, if enrolment closes on the 25th, you need to request a partial refund by 11:59pm on the 20th at the latest. The refunded amount for an 'Attendance' course will be the difference in price between the Attendance course purchased (except the Attendance (Essentials) Course)&nbsp;and the price of the Online (Comprehensive) package, less $50 administration charge. The refunded amount for the Attendance (Essentials) Course will be $400 (this amount is net of administration charge).&nbsp;The user will retain all features of the Online package (or in&nbsp;the case of the Attendance (Essentials) Course, user will retain MCQ Bank and Course Video access).
