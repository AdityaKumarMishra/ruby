<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Most Universities use a MMI format. The MMI is a series of 5 to 10 interview stations consisting of timed interview scenarios, which allow to assess soft skills such as interpersonal skills or ethical and moral judgement. Applicants rotate through the stations, each of which has its own interviewer and task. Tasks may include reacting to a scenario describing an ethical dilemma, traditional interview questions like “why do you want to attend this school?” or even essay writing.

<ul>
    <li>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%" align="justify">Full-fee places are expected to pay the full cost of the course.</p>

    <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 100%" align="justify">CSP (Commonwealth-sponsored places) places are subsidised by the government and tuition fees are reduced to a fraction of the full-paying fee. CSP places are extremely competitive and only the top-ranked students qualify.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%" align="justify">BSP, or bonded-scheme places allow students to attend at a discounted price, provided that they commit to working in area of workforce shortage for a duration equal to the length of their undergraduate course. BSP has 2 different schemes:</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%" align="justify">- Bonded Medical Place (BMP): requires graduates to work in districts of workforce shortage (generally speaking, outside of major cities) for 4 years*.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%" align="justify">- Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship (MRBS): requires graduates to work in rural or remote areas for 6 years and comes with an annual scholarship of approximately $26,000 for the duration of the degree.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">What are the differences between undergraduate, guaranteed, provisional entry and postgraduate entry?</span>
    </strong>
</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Two main types of medical degrees exist: the undergraduate and the postgraduate degree. The undergraduate degree starts straight after high school and lasts 5 to 6 years. Admission usually relies on a combination of UMAT and ATAR scores. The postgraduate degree is undertaken after a first undergraduate degree and lasts 4 years. Graduate entry requires to sit the GAMSAT.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Guaranteed entry in post-graduate courses may be offered to Year 12 students with very high ATAR scores, with the understanding that students must first complete an undergraduate degree. These students are not required to sit the GAMSAT or the UMAT.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">In provisional entry, students are selected based on their UMAT and ATAR scores, as in undergraduate entry, however they are required to enrol in an undergraduate course (either pre-med or another subject) for 2 to 3 years and to maintain a minimum grade throughout the course in order to be progress onto a post-graduate medical degree.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">How is GAMSAT score calculated?</span>
    </strong>
</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The GAMSAT has 3 sections. Questions within each section are first given a raw score, which is then converted to a scaled score, based on how many correct answers were given that year. The overall GAMSAT score is calculated as follow:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">
    <b>Overall score= (Section 1 score + Section 2 score + 2xSection 3 score)/4</b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">This overall score is what is used by most medical schools in the admissions process. The University of Melbourne is an exception however, and uses a slightly different system to compute an applicant’s overall GAMSAT score. They weight all sections of the GAMSAT evenly.</p>
