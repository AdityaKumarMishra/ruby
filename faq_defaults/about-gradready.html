We are mainly differentiated by 3 points - one, we value high student engagement, that is why our live classes are interactive and our online videos are produced to be interesting as well as informative; two, we value targeted learning, which is the driver&nbsp;behind&nbsp;our Intelligent MCQ and Cross Referencing systems and why&nbsp;our tutors focus on teaching how to apply the concepts&nbsp;covered in the GAMSAT; three, we have an Australia-leading online system that seamlessly integrates all the information and practice material you need, at your fingertips, making learning easier than you have previously known.&nbsp;For more information, please see&nbsp;

    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">In May 2015, we surveyed&nbsp;over 1000 students who we had helped to prepare for the March 2015 GAMSAT.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The average Overall score amongst respondents was 63.1&nbsp;(Standard Deviation 6.4) - which translates into a&nbsp;score that places the average GAMSATReady student in the 75th percentile of the 2014 March GAMSAT.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">A subgroup of the respondents had previous taken the GAMSAT - the&nbsp;Overall scores of students in this group rose from an average of 59.3&nbsp;(SD 4.9) to 64.3&nbsp;(SD 5.4). So that means the average GAMSAT re-taker, after doing the GAMSATReady course, increased their score from one that placed them in the 55th percentile to one that placed them in the 80th percentile. This improvement remains statistically significant even when assessed using 99% confidence intervals.</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Survey of our 2013-14 students was done in June 2014.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The average Overall score amongst respondents was 65.4 (Standard Deviation 6.1) - which translates into a&nbsp;score that places the average GAMSATReady student in the 87th percentile of the 2014 March GAMSAT.</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">A subgroup of the respondents had previous taken the GAMSAT - the Overall scores of students in this group rose from an average of 60.6 (SD 3.7) to 67.8 (SD 4.1). So that means the average GAMSAT re-taker, after doing the GAMSATReady course, increased their score from one that placed them in the 68th percentile to one that placed them in the 92nd percentile. This improvement remains statistically significant even when assessed using 99% confidence intervals.</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Our curriculum was written specifically to prepare students for the GAMSAT. The writers included University of Melbourne postgraduate medical students, a number of whom have lectured at a university level and all of whom have achieved high scores in the GAMSAT. The GAMSATReady team inherently know what is needed for entry into Australian Medical Schools.</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">It depends on your familiarity with each subject matter. While most of students find our material to be sufficient, you may find that your fundamentals are particularly weak in a certain area, let it be basic math, biology or reading comprehension. In these cases it is important for you to consult additional material; we do recommend further readings in our Textbook for each subject for those who are struggling.</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Yes. While the course was designed as a comprehensive review for the GAMSAT, the students will need to practise and consolidate knowledge learnt in class. For students who are not strong in the sciences â€“ for you to get the most out of our tutors, we strongly recommend that you go through our online videos thoroughly prior to attending our live classes.</span>

    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Optimally, between 50 - 125 hours. As you know, one of the unique aspects of GAMSATReady is that during the live classes, we focus on the application of concepts, rather than introducing the concepts to you for the first time. As such, you need to put in a certain amount of work, at your own pace,&nbsp;before coming to class.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">There are 25 hours of online videos available. If you already have a fair grasp of concepts covered in the GAMSAT, then we estimate it would take you about 50 hours (2 hours for each hour of video) to work through all the videos, assuming that you pause the videos on occasions to seek clarification through&nbsp;the Textbook/Tutors Online/Internet. If you are not at all familiar with the concepts covered in the GAMSAT however,&nbsp;then we estimate it could take you up to 5 hours to work through each hour of video, resulting in approximately 125 hours of preparation time.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">If you are short on time, then we recommend that you look at the Study Guide at the beginning of each subject - where there is a list of videos you absolutely need to watch before each class (exception here is Humanities, for which we recommend you watch all videos before coming to class). The reason why we do not encourage you to just watching the minimum number of videos before each class is that difficult GAMSAT questions often incorporate multiple concepts - meaning that you may not fully appreciate what the tutor has to say, until you have a fuller overall understanding. So even though each class is designed to focus on a few concepts, some of the difficult MCQs covered during a particular class may require understanding of concepts not covered in that particular class.</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Students will need to demonstrate an adequate command of English and arithmetic skills, which are also required for the GAMSAT. In addition, we highly recommend student who are not strong in the sciences to prepare prior to attending the live courses. You may prepare by accessing our online video. Watching the videos thoroughly will help you to get the most out of our tutors in class.</span>
