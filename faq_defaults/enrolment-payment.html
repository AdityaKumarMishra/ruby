</h3>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Purchases of the "Custom" and "Online" packages, as well as all upgrades made after initial purchase of packages&nbsp;are final and non-refundable. Partial refunds are available for all Live packages, until 5 working days prior to enrolment closure. For example, if enrolment closes on the 25th, you need to request a partial refund by 11:59pm on the 20th at the latest. The refunded amount for a Live course will be the difference in price between the Live course purchased (except the All Topics Lite Live Course)&nbsp;and the price of the Online package, less $50 administration charge. The refunded amount for the All Topics Lite Live Course will be $450 (this amount is net of administration charge). The user will retain all features of the Online package (or in&nbsp;the case of the&nbsp;All Topics Lite Live Course, user will retain MCQ Bank and Course Video access). Note that all online features expire the day after the upcoming March GAMSAT.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Similarly, partial refunds are available for InterviewReady packages, but only until 5 working days prior to enrolment closure.

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">There are several scenarios to consider here.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Firstly, transfer is not allowed for any online material, which impact the all online and custom courses, as well as the online component of live courses.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Secondly, transfer is allowed for the live component of the live courses, given that the request is made more than 5 days prior to enrolment closure and that the new student purchases the corresponding online course. In this scenario, a $50 administration fee is also payable.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Thirdly, transfer is also allowed for the Live Exam Day, given that you had purchased it separately through the Custom course (ie. you cannot transfer the Live Exam Day to another student if it came as a part of a package) and that the request is made more than 5 days prior to the Live Exam Day. A $50 administration fee is payable.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">With InterviewReady courses, transfers to friends&nbsp;will be allowed, upto 5 days prior to enrolment closure, for a fee of $150 to cover admin fees, online video access to date and printed material.</span>

One of our core beliefs is that the student-teacher interaction afforded by a small class size is invaluable to learning. As such, we are compromising on quality, every time we insert an unplanned student into a class.</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Therefore, in the event of such requests, we implement a strict review process.

All attendance course fees can be split into 3 equal payments. Online access will be given after 2 payments have been received. The 1st payment is non-refundable. Once online access is given, our usual Refund Policy applies.</span>

    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">No. Unfortunately the packages' basic structures are locked and cannot be altered in any way. However, you do have the option to purchase only specific features through our Custom course option.</span>

You may also scan the written essays and send them in for marking. Note that you do NOT need to attend the Mock Exam and Recap Days in the same city as the live course, if your studies require you to be in a different city in March.</span>
