    <span style="color: #000000;">If you’re a high school or university student, the UMAT will be unlike any exam you’ve sat before. Rather than testing knowledge of a particular topic, each section corresponds to different skills that are favoured in medical and health science professions. This is reflected in the titles of each section; Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving, Understanding People and Non-Verbal Reasoning. Simply studying and memorising material isn’t enough for the UMAT. If you want to show your full potential in the UMAT, you need to practice using the skills that will be tested. By enrolling in a&nbsp;UMAT preparation course, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to hone these skills.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="color: #000000;">As with all exams, familiarising yourself with the format and style of questions can give you a huge edge for a relatively small amount of effort. Being comfortable with the style of questions and the format of the exam beforehand will give you confidence, and ensure that you stay calm during the UMAT.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="color: #000000;">Of course, you won’t be doing this all alone. Our UMAT tutors at GradReady have all scored well in the UMAT and will have a wealth of tips, tricks and techniques to share with you based on their own experiences.</span>

<p>Think through the following scenario. Imagine that you are driving to your lodge in a small town, during a trip in a new country. Maybe you think that your brain and a map are all you would need, and you would make it to your destination easily. But that's only in theory. In reality, you probably stopped to ask for directions, you were probably confused and distracted by the various foreign road signs and driving norms, and you probably had to turn back a few times due to mistakes. In reality, the drive was a lot more difficult than you thought, and a local, who is more familiar with the roads will always get to the destination more quickly and make less wrong turns than you would, even if you are a renowned rally driver. But it's ok, you weren't in a race; you weren't completing against the local.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now look at the UMAT. The UMAT exam is the drive. Some people say that all you need are the general skills that you had picked up throughout your life - that is your brain and map in our previous scenario. But that's only in theory. In reality, you need guidance, you would benefit from being taught to recognise the various conventions and question types in the UMAT, and you do not have the time to constantly go back to correct your mistakes. In reality, if you are familiar with both the core concepts and how to approach questions based on those concepts, you will always do better than someone who is not.</div>

            <span style="color: rgb(1, 136, 202);">How important is repeated practice?</span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Very, very important.
    <br>
    <br>
    The following is an extract from an article in the August 2015 issue of the Harvard Business Review, which explains the point very well.
    <br>
    <br>
    "A review of 50 scientific studies with more than 130,000 participants shows that practice boosts performance on pretty much any kind of test, for three reasons.&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
    First, it decreases anxiety. As you'd imagine, the more trial runs you've had, the more confident and calm you'll be when taking a high-stakes test, because the various formats and questions, as well the entire experience, will seem more familiar. You'll also discover what you don't know, so you can brush up and feel more prepared.&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
    Second, practice makes proven test-taking strategies, such as skipping and revisiting difficult questions, come more naturally when the pressure is on. You'll learn to ignore irrelevant information and make fewer errors in interpretation.&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
    And third, repeated test taking can help you develop the very qualities that employers measure. Neuroscientific evidence suggests that brain-training programs, including skill-based video games, can enhance your focus and your ability to detect patterns - skills that most aptitude testing is designed to assess."

            <span style="color: #0188ca;">How early should I sign up to a UMAT preparation course?</span>

    </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The more time you give yourself to prepare and practice for the UMAT, the better. Of course, no one wants to spend their entire life studying for one exam. The UMAT is typically held around late July. Signing up for a preparation course around January, which for many, is school/university holidays, gives you six months. Six months strikes a good balance between having sufficient time to identify and work on weaknesses without making the preparation process drag on..</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3 id="how-much">
        <strong>
            <span style="color: #0188ca;">How much preparation do I have to do for the UMAT?</span>
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The short answer is: enough to feel comfortable with the practice tests.</p>
    <p>At the very least, do a few practice exams in the month leading up to the examination date.If you’ve got enough time, do more. You’re not going to get worse by doing morepractice.</p>
    <p>However, do maintain your physical and mental health while preparing for the UMAT. Leave time to exercise, socialise and sleep; do not underestimate the impact your health and happiness have your ability to study and perform in the UMAT.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3 id="what-level">
        <strong>
            <span style="color: #0188ca;">What level of knowledge is required for the UMAT?</span>
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You do not need to know any science for UMAT. Your ATAR or university results serve the purpose of assessing relevant knowledge for medical and health science degrees.Remember, the UMAT tests skills, rather than knowledge.</p>
    <p>However, the UMAT does require a good comprehension of English. You will need to read and comprehend a body of text quickly for each question in “Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving” and “Understanding People”. The importance of comprehension is doubly important in the latter section; many of the answers may sound similar or subjective, but are distinguished by the choice of words used.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3 id="i-have">
        <strong>
            <span style="color: #0188ca;">I have heard the UMAT is hard, why shouldn’t I focus my efforts on pursuing the graduate medical path instead?</span>
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Once again, people find the UMAT hard because it’s most likely the first time they’ve been formally examined on their reasoning and empathetic abilities. Similarly, as discussed above, people believe that you cannot actively improve these skills.&nbsp;If you can get around this mental block that you can’t prepare for the UMAT, you’ll find this to be much more manageable.</p>
    <p>The graduate equivalent of the UMAT, the GAMSAT, demands a considerable amount of prerequisite knowledge. While studying this prerequisite knowledge is a fairly straightforward task, it’s rather time consuming and boring. Another factor to take into account is that the GAMSAT costs considerably more. The UMAT registration fee is $240 ($140) with concession. The GAMSAT on the other hand costs $455.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the end, this decision is entirely up to you. The skills that you use in the UMAT are applicable in all walks of life, so even if you prepare for it and don’t succeed, it won’t go to waste.</p>

    <p>It’s easy to assess yourself on how well you did in a practice exam. It’s really difficult for you to practice an interview by yourself and gauge your performance accurately. A interview preparation course brings in a new perspective to help you identify bad habits and weaknesses that might hurt your chances. In addition, with the increasing popularity of multiple mini interviews (MMI), being familiar with this format will help you be mentally prepared for this process. As with the exam,practice, along with a few tips, will go a long way with improving your performance in an interview.</p>
