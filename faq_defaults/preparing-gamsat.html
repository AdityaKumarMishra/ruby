    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">There are 3 main reasons:</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Firstly, you need to be reminded of the concepts tested in the GAMSAT. The GAMSAT covers a vast breadth of knowledge, from social sciences to essay writing to life and natural sciences. You become very rusty at anything you don’t use on a regular basis; the chances are that you will have at least a few major “rust spots”.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Secondly, you should familiarise yourself with the test. You may have a good knowledge base, but you need to put the knowledge into context. The way that the GAMSAT assesses your knowledge is not always straightforward.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Thirdly, you would benefit immensely from the insights of our experienced GAMSAT tutors, all of whom scored well at the GAMSAT. While there is no substitute for hard work, our experiences have taught us that most students could work smarter – both in terms of how to study and approaching the GAMSAT questions.</span>

</h3>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">To understand how the 3 points mentioned above help you with the GAMSAT, think through the following scenario. Imagine that you are driving to your lodge in a small town, during a trip in a new country. Maybe you think that your brain and a map are all you would need, and you would make it to your destination easily. But that's only in theory. In reality, you probably stopped to ask for directions, you were probably confused and distracted by the various foreign road signs and driving norms, and you probably had to turn back a few times due to mistakes. In reality, the drive was a lot more difficult than you thought, and a local, who is more familiar with the roads will always get to the destination more quickly and make less wrong turns than you would, even if you are a renowned rally driver. But it's ok, you weren't in a race; you weren't completing against the local.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Now look at the GAMSAT. The GAMSAT exam is the drive. Some people say that all you need are the general skills that you had picked up throughout your life - that is your brain and map in our previous scenario. But that's only in theory. In reality, you need guidance, you would benefit from being taught to recognise the various conventions and question types in the GAMSAT, and you do not have the time to constantly go back to correct your mistakes. In reality, if you are familiar with both the core concepts and how to approach questions based on those concepts, you will always do better than someone who is not.</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">We recommend that you start 6 months prior to sitting the GAMSAT – i.e in September if you are sitting the March GAMSAT. The reasoning&nbsp;is that you don’t know what you'll need to work on,&nbsp;until you&nbsp;seriously start to work on preparing for the GAMSAT;&nbsp;6 months should be enough time for you to work on your weaknesses without suffering from preparation fatigue.</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">If you intend to sign up for our live course, we recommend that you sign up 1 or more months prior to the live classes -&nbsp;so you have&nbsp;enough time, prior to the course, to work through our videos at a comfortable pace.&nbsp;Doing so will allow you to better reap the benefits of the live classes - which will be focused on GAMSAT strategies and the application of knowledge through dissecting MCQs.</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The best measuring stick - prepare until you are comfortable with the practice tests.</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Considering the impact of the GAMSAT score on a candidate’s career pathway in medical or allied health careers, we would always recommended a conservative approach.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">
What this means practically is that you should at least do a few practice tests, if you feel that you are a strong candidate, to assess your knowledge. You should also sign up to GAMSATReady's&nbsp;<a href="/">
    <font color="black">GAMSAT preparation program</font>
</a>&nbsp;early, so that you can identify and put in a considerable amount of effort to improve your weaknesses, especially if you are a cautious candidate or a candidate from a non-science background. However, as the GAMSAT is a diverse test, biomedical undergraduate and science undergraduate students require tutelage and direction in certain areas.

A good English proficiency and a habit of reading widely will help you to score well sections I and II; however, sections I and II are where biomedical and science undergraduate students have struggled the most, and these areas have been stopping these students from entering medical school especially</span>

We will help you identify areas that you need to work on for a medical school interview. Most people have bad habits, and the habits are invariably magnified during the interviews. In addition, there are certain general strategies that are important for you to know about multiple mini interviews (MMI),&nbsp;<a href="/gamsat-preparation-courses/interview-attendance-comprehensive">
