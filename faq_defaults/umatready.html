Our
<a href="https://www.gradready.com.au/umat-preparation-courses/UMATReady">UMAT preparation courses</a>
are mainly differentiated by 3 points - one, we value high student engagement, that is why our live classes are interactive and our online videos are produced to be interesting as well as informative; two, we value targeted learning, which is the driver&nbsp;behind&nbsp;our Intelligent MCQ and Cross Referencing systems and why&nbsp;our tutors focus on teaching how to apply the concepts&nbsp;covered in the UMAT; three, we have an Australia-leading online system that seamlessly integrates all the information and practice material you need, at your fingertips, making learning easier than you have previously known.&nbsp;For more information, please see&nbsp;

        <span style="color: #0188ca;">Does UMATReady cover everything that is tested in the UMAT?</span>
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span style="color: #333333;">Our curriculum was written specifically to prepare students for the UMAT. All writers have scored in the top 5% of the UMAT and went onto attend medical school. As such, the UMATReady team inherently knows what is needed for entry into Australian Medical Schools.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="do-i-need">
    <strong>
        <span style="color: #0188ca;">Do I need any preparation material in addition to those provided by&nbsp;UMATReady?</span>
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span style="color: #333333;">It depends on your familiarity with each subject matter. While most students find our material to be sufficient, you may find that your fundamentals are particularly weak in a certain area, let it be vocabulary (in particular words used to describe emotions), reading comprehension or logical reasoning. In these cases it is important for you to consult additional material; we do recommend further readings/exercises in our Textbook&nbsp;for those who wish to consult the material.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="will-i-have">
    <strong>
        <span style="color: #0188ca;">Will I have to do study outside UMATReady program dates?</span>
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span style="color: #333333;">Yes. While the course was designed as a comprehensive review for the UMAT, the students will need to practise and consolidate information/techniques learnt in class. For you to get the most out of our tutors, we strongly recommend that you go through our online videos thoroughly prior to attending our live classes.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="how-long">
    <strong>
        <span style="color: #0188ca;">How long does it take to prepare for UMATReady Live classes?&nbsp;</span>
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span style="color: #333333;">Optimally, between 40- 100 hours. As you know, one of the unique aspects of UMATReady is that during the live classes, we focus on the application of concepts rather than introducing the concepts to you for the first time. As such, you need to put in a certain amount of work, at your own pace,&nbsp;before coming to class.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="color: #333333;">There are&nbsp;20 hours of online videos available. If you already have a fair grasp of concepts covered in the UMAT, then we estimate it would take you about 40 hours (2 hours for each hour of video)&nbsp;to work&nbsp;through all the videos, assuming that you pause the videos on occasions to seek clarification through&nbsp;the Textbook/Tutors Online/Internet. If you are not at all familiar with the concepts covered in the UMAT however,&nbsp;then we estimate it could take you up to 5 hours to work through each hour of video, resulting in approximately 100 hours of preparation time.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="color: #333333;">If you are short on time, then we recommend that you look at the Study Guide at the beginning of each subject - where there is a list of videos you absolutely need to watch&nbsp;before each class.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we do not encourage you to just watching the minimum number of videos before each class is that&nbsp;difficult UMAT questions often incorporate multiple concepts -meaning that you may not fully appreciate what the tutor has to say,until&nbsp;you have a fuller overall understanding.&nbsp;So even though each class is designed to focus on a few concepts, some of the difficult MCQs covered during a particular class may require understanding of concepts not covered in that particular class.</span>

    </strong>
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span style="color: #333333;">Students will need to demonstrate an adequate command of English and arithmetic skills. You may prepare by accessing our online video. Watching the videos thoroughly will help you to get the most out of our tutors in class.</span>
