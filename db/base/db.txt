Rather than testing knowledge of a particular topic, each section corresponds to different skills that are favoured in medical and health science professions. This is reflected in the titles of each section; Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving, Understanding People and Non-Verbal Reasoning. Simply studying and memorising material isn’t enough for the UMAT. If you want to show your full potential in the UMAT, you need to practice using the skills that will be tested. By enrolling in a&nbsp;UMAT preparation course, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to hone these skills.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="color: #000000;">As with all exams, familiarising yourself with the format and style of questions can give you a huge edge for a relatively small amount of effort. Being comfortable with the style of questions and the format of the exam beforehand will give you confidence, and ensure that you stay calm during the UMAT.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="color: #000000;">Of course, you won’t be doing this all alone. Our UMAT tutors at GradReady have all scored well in the UMAT and will have a wealth of tips, tricks and techniques to share with you based on their own experiences.</span>\n</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id="i-still">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="color: #0188ca;">I still don’t quite understand, I’m told the UMAT cannot be prepared for?</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Think through the following scenario. Imagine that you are driving to your lodge in a small town, during a trip in a new country. Maybe you think that your brain and a map are all you would need, and you would make it to your destination easily. But that's only in theory. In reality, you probably stopped to ask for directions, you were probably confused and distracted by the various foreign road signs and driving norms, and you probably had to turn back a few times due to mistakes. In reality, the drive was a lot more difficult than you thought, and a local, who is more familiar with the roads will always get to the destination more quickly and make less wrong turns than you would, even if you are a renowned rally driver. But it's ok, you weren't in a race; you weren't completing against the local.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Now look at the UMAT. The UMAT exam is the drive. Some people say that all you need are the general skills that you had picked up throughout your life - that is your brain and map in our previous scenario. But that's only in theory. In reality, you need guidance, you would benefit from being taught to recognise the various conventions and question types in the UMAT, and you do not have the time to constantly go back to correct your mistakes. In reality, if you are familiar with both the core concepts and how to approach questions based on those concepts, you will always do better than someone who is not.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n    The UMAT Ready course shows you what it means to be truly familiar with the UMAT, and that's why UMAT Ready students&nbsp;do so well.

As you'd imagine, the more trial runs you've had, the more confident and calm you'll be when taking a high-stakes test, because the various formats and questions, as well the entire experience, will seem more familiar. You'll also discover what you don't know, so you can brush up and feel more prepared.&nbsp;\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Second, practice makes proven test-taking strategies, such as skipping and revisiting difficult questions, come more naturally when the pressure is on. You'll learn to ignore irrelevant information and make fewer errors in interpretation.&nbsp;\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    And third, repeated test taking can help you develop the very qualities that employers measure. Neuroscientific evidence suggests that brain-training programs, including skill-based video games, can enhance your focus and your ability to detect patterns - skills that most aptitude testing is designed to assess."\n</p>\n<div>\n    <div>&nbsp;</div>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n    <h3 id="how-early">\n        <strong>\n            <span style="color: #0188ca;">How early should I sign up to a UMAT preparation course?</span>\n        </strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The more time you give yourself to prepare and practice for the UMAT, the better. Of course, no one wants to spend their entire life studying for one exam. The UMAT is typically held around late July. Signing up for a preparation course around January, which for many, is school/university holidays, gives you six months. Six months strikes a good balance between having sufficient time to identify and work on weaknesses without making the preparation process drag on..</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <h3 id="how-much">\n        <strong>\n            <span style="color: #0188ca;">How much preparation do I have to do for the UMAT?</span>\n        </strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The short answer is: enough to feel comfortable with the practice tests.</p>\n    <p>At the very least, do a few practice exams in the month leading up to the examination date.If you’ve got enough time, do more. You’re not going to get worse by doing morepractice.</p>\n    <p>However, do maintain your physical and mental health while preparing for the UMAT. Leave time to exercise, socialise and sleep; do not underestimate the impact your health and happiness have your ability to study and perform in the UMAT.</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <h3 id="what-level">\n        <strong>\n            <span style="color: #0188ca;">What level of knowledge is required for the UMAT?</span>\n        </strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>You do not need to know any science for UMAT. Your ATAR or university results serve the purpose of assessing relevant knowledge for medical and health science degrees.Remember, the UMAT tests skills, rather than knowledge.</p>\n    <p>However, the UMAT does require a good comprehension of English. You will need to read and comprehend a body of text quickly for each question in “Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving” and “Understanding People”. The importance of comprehension is doubly important in the latter section; many of the answers may sound similar or subjective, but are distinguished by the choice of words used.</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <h3 id="i-have">\n        <strong>\n            <span style="color: #0188ca;">I have heard the UMAT is hard, why shouldn’t I focus my efforts on pursuing the graduate medical path instead?</span>\n        </strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Once again, people find the UMAT hard because it’s most likely the first time they’ve been formally examined on their reasoning and empathetic abilities. Similarly, as discussed above, people believe that you cannot actively improve these skills.&nbsp;If you can get around this mental block that you can’t prepare for the UMAT, you’ll find this to be much more manageable.</p>\n    <p>The graduate equivalent of the UMAT, the GAMSAT, demands a considerable amount of prerequisite knowledge. While studying this prerequisite knowledge is a fairly straightforward task, it’s rather time consuming and boring. Another factor to take into account is that the GAMSAT costs considerably more. The UMAT registration fee is $240 ($140) with concession. The GAMSAT on the other hand costs $455.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In the end, this decision is entirely up to you. The skills that you use in the UMAT are applicable in all walks of life, so even if you prepare for it and don’t succeed, it won’t go to waste.</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <h3 id="i-don't">\n        <strong>\n            <span style="color: #0188ca;">I don’t have a science background, how will this affect my chances of doing well in the UMAT</span>\n        </strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>No science knowledge is required for the UMAT.</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <h3 id="why-should">\n        <strong>\n            <span style="color: #0188ca;">Why should I enrol in a preparation course for the interview?</span>\n        </strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>It’s easy to assess yourself on how well you did in a practice exam. It’s really difficult for you to practice an interview by yourself and gauge your performance accurately. A interview preparation course brings in a new perspective to help you identify bad habits and weaknesses that might hurt your chances. In addition, with the increasing popularity of multiple mini interviews (MMI), being familiar with this format will help you be mentally prepared for this process. As with the exam,practice, along with a few tips, will go a long way with improving your performance in an interview.</p>\n</div>\n</span>\n<hr class="b_top_h">\n	2016-09-26 08:57:37.626349	2016-09-26 08:57:37.626349

All writers have scored in the top 5% of the UMAT and went onto attend medical school. As such, the UMATReady team inherently knows what is needed for entry into Australian Medical Schools.</span>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id="do-i-need">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="color: #0188ca;">Do I need any preparation material in addition to those provided by&nbsp;UMATReady?</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="color: #333333;">It depends on your familiarity with each subject matter. While most students find our material to be sufficient, you may find that your fundamentals are particularly weak in a certain area, let it be vocabulary (in particular words used to describe emotions), reading comprehension or logical reasoning. In these cases it is important for you to consult additional material; we do recommend further readings/exercises in our Textbook&nbsp;for those who wish to consult the material.</span>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id="will-i-have">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="color: #0188ca;">Will I have to do study outside UMATReady program dates?</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="color: #333333;">Yes. While the course was designed as a comprehensive review for the UMAT, the students will need to practise and consolidate information/techniques learnt in class. For you to get the most out of our tutors, we strongly recommend that you go through our online videos thoroughly prior to attending our live classes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id="how-long">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="color: #0188ca;">How long does it take to prepare for UMATReady Live classes?&nbsp;</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="color: #333333;">Optimally, between 40- 100 hours. As you know, one of the unique aspects of UMATReady is that during the live classes, we focus on the application of concepts rather than introducing the concepts to you for the first time. As such, you need to put in a certain amount of work, at your own pace,&nbsp;before coming to class.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="color: #333333;">There are&nbsp;20 hours of online videos available. If you already have a fair grasp of concepts covered in the UMAT, then we estimate it would take you about 40 hours (2 hours for each hour of video)&nbsp;to work&nbsp;through all the videos, assuming that you pause the videos on occasions to seek clarification through&nbsp;the Textbook/Tutors Online/Internet. If you are not at all familiar with the concepts covered in the UMAT however,&nbsp;then we estimate it could take you up to 5 hours to work through each hour of video, resulting in approximately 100 hours of preparation time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="color: #333333;">If you are short on time, then we recommend that you look at the Study Guide at the beginning of each subject - where there is a list of videos you absolutely need to watch&nbsp;before each class.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we do not encourage you to just watching the minimum number of videos before each class is that&nbsp;difficult UMAT questions often incorporate multiple concepts -meaning that you may not fully appreciate what the tutor has to say,until&nbsp;you have a fuller overall understanding.&nbsp;So even though each class is designed to focus on a few concepts, some of the difficult MCQs covered during a particular class may require understanding of concepts not covered in that particular class.</span>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id="is-there">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="color: #0188ca;">Is there any prerequisite knowledge required for UMATReady?&nbsp;</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="color: #333333;">Students will need to demonstrate an adequate command of English and arithmetic skills.

These usually include a combination of UMAT and ATAR, as well as an interview. Due to this combination of scores, there is usually no distinct cut-off value; a student with a very high ATAR and low UMAT may receive an interview offer, and vice versa. Cut-offs values for UMAT scores are sometimes shown on the University website but are often kept confidential, though it is possible to form a general idea by looking at students’ profiles.

In universities that consider the UMAT and ATAR equally, the score of an individual UMAT section may be used when differentiating between students of similar marks.</p>\n<p>Please refer to our comprehensive description of admission criteria for more details.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n    <a id="what ATAR">What ATAR score do I need to get into med school?</a>\n</h3>\n<p>Every school has different selection criteria and admission requirements. These usually include a combination of UMAT and ATAR, as well as an interview. Due to this combination of scores, there is usually no distinct cut-off value; a student with a very high ATAR and low UMAT may receive an interview offer, and vice versa. Furthermore, these criteria may be different between students applying to the same course due to factors such as rural or metropolitan schooling.

The MMI is a series of 5 to 10 interview stations consisting of timed interview scenarios, allowing the assessment of soft skills such as interpersonal skills or ethical and moral judgement. Applicants rotate through the stations, each of which has its own interviewer and task/s. Tasks may include reacting to a scenario describing an ethical dilemma, traditional interview questions like “why do you want to attend this school?” or even essay writing.

Students in this scheme undertake the majority of their clinical education within hospitals or community based practises in regional or rural areas.</p>\n<p>From the 2016 academic year onwards, the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship (MRBS) Scheme will be closed to new applicants. The 100 medical places per year which were available for MRBS commencing medical students will be transferred for use in the BMP scheme.</p>\n<p>\n    <br>\n    &nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>The numbers and type of places in medical school varies between universities. In addition, some universities set aside places for students originating from rural area, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, as well as for international students.

Graduate entry requires sitting of the GAMSAT.</p>\n<p>Guaranteed entry in post-graduate courses may be offered to Year 12 students with very high ATAR scores, with the understanding that students must first complete an undergraduate degree before entering a post-graduate medical degree. These students are not required to sit the GAMSAT or the UMAT.</p>\n<p>In provisional entry, students are selected based on their UMAT and ATAR scores, as in undergraduate entry. However, students are required to enrol in an undergraduate course (either pre-med or another course) for 2 to 3 years and to maintain a minimum grade throughout the course in order to be progress on to a post-graduate medical degree.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n    <a id="UMAT score calc">How is UMAT score calculated?</a>\n</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>UMAT results include scores for each of the three sections, as well as an aggregated score. The score for each section is expressed on a scale of 0 to 100, though this is a not a percentage score. ACER has not released any information regarding how each of the section scores are calculated.</p>\n</span>\n<hr class="b_top_h">\n	2016-09-26 08:57:37.650577	2016-09-26 08:57:37.650577

Candidates leaving during Section I or II will not receive their GAMSAT scores. Candidates leaving during Section III due to illness are expected to provide a medical certificate explaining their need to leave the test centre. This must be provided no later than&nbsp;<strong>seven days&nbsp;</strong>after the test day. Failure to do so may result in scores not being released.\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Once a candidate has departed the test centre it is not possible to re-enter and continue the test.</span>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="how-frequently-is-the-gamsat-held">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">How frequently is the GAMSAT Held?</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">It is held annually, in mid-March.</span>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="how-long-are-the-results-valid">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">For how long are the results valid?</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The results are valid for 2 years. For example, if you sit the exam during March 2016, the result will be valid for your 2016 application for a medical or health sciences program commencing in 2017; it will also be valid for your 2017 application for a program commencing in 2018; but it will not be valid for your 2018 application.</span>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="how-many-times-can-i-take-the-gamsat">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">How many times can I take the GAMSAT?</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">There is no restriction on the number of retakes. In fact, many students do sit the exam twice or more. If you have sat the exam multiple times, you may choose which result to include in your application. Universities will not have access to the scores that you choose to not submit.</span>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="when-should-i-sit-the-gamsat">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">When should I sit the GAMSAT?</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">We recommend that you should, at the latest, sit the GAMSAT during the year prior to the year of your medical school application. For example, if you are applying in 2017 to medical school starting in 2018, then you should sit the exam in March 2016 at the latest. The reasoning here is that you have another chance to achieve a good score for your 2017 application. Unfortunately, people often perform subpar under pressure.</span>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="i-am-currently-in-the-first-year">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">I am currently in first year, can/should I do the GAMSAT in March next year?</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">If you are currently in your first year, you are eligible to attempt the GAMSAT in March next year. Since Universities will not have direct access to all of your scores, many students sit the GAMSAT more than once and include only their best score in their application to medical school or the other health science areas of study. Therefore, we recommend that you aim to sit the exam as early as possible, which gives you additional opportunities to improve upon your score.</span>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="can-i-take-a-dictionary">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">Can I take a dictionary with me into the GAMSAT Exam?</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Standard English dictionaries are not permitted.

Even if it feels like one exam was easy than the other in a given year, the result is a reflection of your relative performance and therefore the difficulty level of the exam shouldn’t matter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">In terms of exam content and conditions, there is no difference between the Australian GAMSAT and the UK GAMSAT. While one takes place in autumn and the other takes place in spring, there should be no other difference in conditions. Both exams will go for the full day and comprise of the same three sections. Preparation courses for one exam are equally useful for the next exam.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The results of both exams can be used to apply for medical school in the two consecutive years after you sit the exam. The only significant difference is when you can use your GAMSAT score to apply for medical school entry. With the Australian GAMSAT, the results will be released before medical school applications close for the next calendar year, so if you perform well you could potentially start medicine the next year. With the UK GAMSAT, the exam itself only takes place after medical school applications close. This means that you will have to wait one year in between sitting the GAMSAT and potentially starting medical school. This is not always such a bad option for students that might need some time to get ready for the demands of medical school.</span>\n</p>\n<hr class="b_top_h">\n	2016-09-26 08:57:37.909747	2016-09-26 08:57:37.909747

The GAMSAT covers a vast breadth of knowledge, from social sciences to essay writing to life and natural sciences. You become very rusty at anything you don’t use on a regular basis; the chances are that you will have at least a few major “rust spots”.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Secondly, you should familiarise yourself with the test. You may have a good knowledge base, but you need to put the knowledge into context. The way that the GAMSAT assesses your knowledge is not always straightforward.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Thirdly, you would benefit immensely from the insights of our experienced GAMSAT tutors, all of whom scored well at the GAMSAT. While there is no substitute for hard work, our experiences have taught us that most students could work smarter – both in terms of how to study and approaching the GAMSAT questions.</span>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="I still don't quite understand">\n    <strong>\n<span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;"><a name="I still don't quite understand"></a>I still don't quite understand,&nbsp;I'm told that the GAMSAT cannot be prepared for?\n</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">To understand how the 3 points mentioned above help you with the GAMSAT, think through the following scenario. Imagine that you are driving to your lodge in a small town, during a trip in a new country. Maybe you think that your brain and a map are all you would need, and you would make it to your destination easily. But that's only in theory. In reality, you probably stopped to ask for directions, you were probably confused and distracted by the various foreign road signs and driving norms, and you probably had to turn back a few times due to mistakes. In reality, the drive was a lot more difficult than you thought, and a local, who is more familiar with the roads will always get to the destination more quickly and make less wrong turns than you would, even if you are a renowned rally driver. But it's ok, you weren't in a race; you weren't completing against the local.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Now look at the GAMSAT. The GAMSAT exam is the drive. Some people say that all you need are the general skills that you had picked up throughout your life - that is your brain and map in our previous scenario. But that's only in theory. In reality, you need guidance, you would benefit from being taught to recognise the various conventions and question types in the GAMSAT, and you do not have the time to constantly go back to correct your mistakes. In reality, if you are familiar with both the core concepts and how to approach questions based on those concepts, you will always do better than someone who is not.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">\nThe GAMSATReady course shows you what it means to be truly familiar with the GAMSAT, and that's why GAMSATReady students&nbsp;<a href="/student_testimonials#the_stat">\n    <font color="black">do so well</font>\n</a>.

While most of students find our material to be sufficient, you may find that your fundamentals are particularly weak in a certain area, let it be basic math, biology or reading comprehension. In these cases it is important for you to consult additional material; we do recommend further readings in our Textbook for each subject for those who are struggling.</span>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="will-i-have-to-do-study-outside-the-gradready-program">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">Will I have to do study outside GAMSATReady program dates?</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Yes. While the course was designed as a comprehensive review for the GAMSAT, the students will need to practise and consolidate knowledge learnt in class. For students who are not strong in the sciences – for you to get the most out of our tutors, we strongly recommend that you go through our online videos thoroughly prior to attending our live classes.</span>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="How long does it take">\n    <strong>\n        <strong>\n            <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">How long does it take to prepare for GAMSATReady Live classes?&nbsp;</span>\n        </strong>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Optimally, between 50 - 125 hours. As you know, one of the unique aspects of GAMSATReady is that during the live classes, we focus on the application of concepts, rather than introducing the concepts to you for the first time. As such, you need to put in a certain amount of work, at your own pace,&nbsp;before coming to class.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">There are 25 hours of online videos available. If you already have a fair grasp of concepts covered in the GAMSAT, then we estimate it would take you about 50 hours (2 hours for each hour of video) to work through all the videos, assuming that you pause the videos on occasions to seek clarification through&nbsp;the Textbook/Tutors Online/Internet. If you are not at all familiar with the concepts covered in the GAMSAT however,&nbsp;then we estimate it could take you up to 5 hours to work through each hour of video, resulting in approximately 125 hours of preparation time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">If you are short on time, then we recommend that you look at the Study Guide at the beginning of each subject - where there is a list of videos you absolutely need to watch before each class (exception here is Humanities, for which we recommend you watch all videos before coming to class). The reason why we do not encourage you to just watching the minimum number of videos before each class is that difficult GAMSAT questions often incorporate multiple concepts - meaning that you may not fully appreciate what the tutor has to say, until you have a fuller overall understanding. So even though each class is designed to focus on a few concepts, some of the difficult MCQs covered during a particular class may require understanding of concepts not covered in that particular class.</span>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="is-there-any-prerequisite-knowledge-required">\n    <strong>\n        <strong>\n            <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">Is there any prerequisite knowledge required for GAMSATReady?</span>\n        </strong>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Students will need to demonstrate an adequate command of English and arithmetic skills, which are also required for the GAMSAT.

Partial refunds are available for all Live packages, until 5 working days prior to enrolment closure. For example, if enrolment closes on the 25th, you need to request a partial refund by 11:59pm on the 20th at the latest. The refunded amount for a Live course will be the difference in price between the Live course purchased (except the All Topics Lite Live Course)&nbsp;and the price of the Online package, less $50 administration charge. The refunded amount for the All Topics Lite Live Course will be $450 (this amount is net of administration charge). The user will retain all features of the Online package (or in&nbsp;the case of the&nbsp;All Topics Lite Live Course, user will retain MCQ Bank and Course Video access). Note that all online features expire the day after the upcoming March GAMSAT.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Similarly, partial refunds are available for InterviewReady packages, but only until 5 working days prior to enrolment closure.

The only way to get a true sense of how much extra study you need to do is to actually do some GAMSAT questions and go from there. Start off by signing up to our course and going through the content. If you find the videos/context material too challenging as they are, then it means that you need to do some work on basic fundamental concepts. We provide suggested additional reading at the end of many chapters. In addition, depending on the package you have purchased, you will be able to directly ask tutors for specific additional references based on where you are struggling.&nbsp;</span>\n</p>\n<hr class="b_top_h">\n	2016-09-26 08:57:37.972902	2016-09-26 08:57:37.972902

The undergraduate degree starts straight after high school and lasts 5 to 6 years. Admission usually relies on a combination of UMAT and ATAR scores. The postgraduate degree is undertaken after a first undergraduate degree and lasts 4 years. Graduate entry requires to sit the GAMSAT.</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Guaranteed entry in post-graduate courses may be offered to Year 12 students with very high ATAR scores, with the understanding that students must first complete an undergraduate degree. These students are not required to sit the GAMSAT or the UMAT.</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">In provisional entry, students are selected based on their UMAT and ATAR scores, as in undergraduate entry, however they are required to enrol in an undergraduate course (either pre-med or another subject) for 2 to 3 years and to maintain a minimum grade throughout the course in order to be progress onto a post-graduate medical degree.</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">\n    <br>\n    &nbsp;\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="how-is-gamsat">\n    <strong>\n        <span style="font-size: 20px; color:#009348;">How is GAMSAT score calculated?</span>\n    </strong>\n</h3>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The GAMSAT has 3 sections. Questions within each section are first given a raw score, which is then converted to a scaled score, based on how many correct answers were given that year. The overall GAMSAT score is calculated as follow:</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">\n    <b>Overall score= (Section 1 score + Section 2 score + 2xSection 3 score)/4</b>\n</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">This overall score is what is used by most medical schools in the admissions process. The University of Melbourne is an exception however, and uses a slightly different system to compute an applicant’s overall GAMSAT score. They weight all sections of the GAMSAT evenly.</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">\n    <br>\n    &nbsp;\n</p>\n<hr class="b_top_h">\n	2016-09-26 08:57:37.990201	2016-09-26 08:57:37.990201
