          Course Description
        %p
          The Comprehensive InterviewReady course has produced an 100% medical admission rate for its attendees in 2014. This unparalleled achievement is made possible by a detailed analysis by the GradReady team on the MMI process and how each student measures up against the process. Firstly, the MMI black box is demystified by a comprehensive breakdown and discussion of various important scenarios. Moreover, you will then attend the most realistic mock-MMI available in Australia and be given detailed feedback of your performance at each station. All of your interviewers will be successful medical students who thoroughly understand why each scenario is relevant to the lives of doctors.

            %p
              To perform well, you need to understand the underlying principles behind the use of MMI. We will discuss why it is used by medical schools and the schools' expectation of student performance.

            %p
              We will discuss in detail the criteria assessors look for in the MMI. We will also explore the concept of the "ideal" medical candidate, why are certain traits considered important and a self reflection of whether you actually would like to be the said ideal.

              Short of the Mock MMI day of our Comprehensive InterviewReady course, this is the best practice you can partake in. The stations are well designed to reflect the real MMI scenarios and there will be experienced tutors on hand to observe, facilitate and give feedback on the process.
