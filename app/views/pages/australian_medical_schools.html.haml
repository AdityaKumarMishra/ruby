          When trying to get into medical school, we rightly place so much time and effort into studying and preparing for exams and interviews. But the application process itself can be a source of stress and anxiety - how do I apply, how do I order my preferences, what exam do I need to sit, what scores do I need, do I need to move cities, how can I afford this? These are all extremely valid and important questions to ask yourself, and on this page we’ll dive into the details of each Australian medical school and aim to make the application process a little bit smoother.

          Australian Medical School: Undergraduate vs Graduate
        %p
          Simply speaking, there are 2 broad pathways to becoming a doctor in Australia - undergraduate or graduate entry into medical school. The main difference between the two is the point in time in which you can enter the course. The undergraduate pathway is designed for students who are coming straight out of high school, whereas the graduate pathway is designed for students who have already completed a university degree. A more extensive breakdown of the differences can be found on our

          How many years does it take to study medicine in Australia?
        %p
          This is a harder question to answer, as it really depends on the type of degree (undergraduate or graduate) and the exact university. Generally speaking, undergraduate degrees are 5-6 years long, as students will not have completed any previous tertiary education and need to spend the first few years learning the theory before embarking on clinical placements. On the other hand, graduate degrees will take around 4 years to complete. In this case, students will commence clinical placements early on as they will have proven they have the relevant background knowledge through their undergraduate degree, GPA and GAMSAT
          %sup ®
          scores. Keep in mind that this means that overall, graduate students will have been undertaking tertiary studies for a minimum of 7 years by the end of their medical degree. For more information, check out our blog article

          In addition to the simple undergraduate vs graduate schema, there are also 4 universities which offer provisional entry to postgraduate medical degrees for high school leavers. This essentially means that students apply in high school with their UCAT
          %sup ®
          and ATAR results, and are accepted by the university to commence their post-graduate degrees following the completion of an approved Bachelor’s degree at the university. These students will need to maintain a high GPA, but do not need to sit the GAMSAT

          What is the number 1 medical school in Australia?
        %p
          This is a common question asked by prospective (and current) medical students - we are, after all, predominantly A type personalities, and we all want to get into the top schools for medicine. Australian medical schools are consistently well-represented in the top 100 medical schools around the world. Belonging to the 
          %a{href: 'https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2021/medicine', target: :_blank}

          are currently: University of Melbourne - 18th, University of Sydney - 19th, Monash University - 36th and University of New South Wales - 45th (and special mention to the University of Queensland at 51st).
        %p
          However, it can’t be stressed enough that these rankings don’t really matter at all. Unlike the USA where university reputation is widely spoken about with large implications on job prospects, this is fortunately not the case in Australia. In fact, the 
          %a{href: 'https://grattan.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/816-mapping-higher-education-20141.pdf', target: :_blank}
            %strong Grattan Institute Report of 2014-15
          found that financially, “The choice of field of education generally matters more to lifetime earnings than the choice of university.” All medical schools in Australia must hold accreditation from the Australian Medical Council (AMA), and all medical students will graduate with an AHPRA licence and ability to practise medicine. After medical school, there is a whole lifetime of learning left - as tough as it may be to fathom, your university degree is simply the foundation for everything you want to do later on.
        %p
          So, how do we advise students to preference and rank universities if they want to get into the best medical schools in Australia? Ultimately, it is most important that you consider where you actually want to study and where you will be the happiest. Consider factors such as distance from family and friends, the cost of rent and living, whether you want city or rural exposure, class sizes, and ultimately, application requirements and competitiveness. A medical degree requires a lot of time, energy and commitment, and you need to know that you will be comfortable with your decision, especially if it involves

          Do Australian medical schools accept international students?

          Yes, most Australian medical schools accept international students. International students will generally need to apply directly through the university, and may have different eligibility/application requirements. For further information, read each university profile below and, as always, check with each university directly for up-to-date verified information.

          There are three main types of medical student ‘places’ in Australia available to domestic students. These are Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs), Bonded Medical Places (BMPs), and Full-Fee Paying Places (FFPs). The table below summarises what each means and who may be eligible. Further down this page, we will go through how many positions for each type are accepted by each university, as of 2022. It is important to stress however that students should always check with the universities and the GEMSAS guide for the most up-to-date information regarding the numbers and requirements for each type of place. There are other entry pathways that are not outlined in the table below, such as those for Indigenous Australians. This information is also provided by individual universities.

                  The Australian National University (ANU)
              offers a four year Doctor of Medicine and Surgery (MChD) program, based in Canberra. There are a total of 110 places offered, including 64 CSPs, 26 BMPs and up to 20 international places. This includes 40 places reserved for students through one of three ANU pathway programs - the Bachelor of Health Science (30 students, including 10 from rural backgrounds, will be selected based on GPA and interview without needing to sit the GAMSAT

              Applications are made via GEMSAS, where students will be allocated to a place type based on the ranking of the applicant and their submitted preferences. Around 29% of places are reserved for students from a rural background - this should be included in the GEMSAS application. International and Indigenous applicants should apply directly to the ANU.

                Applicants of this Australian medical school must have completed a Bachelor degree within 10 years or be completing the final year of a Bachelor degree at the time of application. This may be waived if at least 0.5 years of full time equivalent tertiary study has been undertaken in the 10 years prior to application.

                  The University of Sydney
              offers a four year Doctor of Medicine (MD) program that is NOT part of the GEMSAS Consortium. USyd is one of the few non-GEMSAS medical schools available out there. USyd made significant changes for 2021 admission in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and these changes have stuck around for 2022 admission and will likely be ongoing.
            %p
              USyd offers around 300 places each year - 75% (around 225 places) are CSPs, both bonded and non-bonded, with an additional 70 FFPs for international students. Students will be able to preference a CSP or BMP allocation in their application. From 2022, the Sydney MD program will be offered in two streams - the Metropolitan Stream based in Sydney’s Camperdown, and the Dubbo Stream based in central-western NSW. Students in the Metropolitan Stream will have their placements based in Sydney but will still have the option for rural placements in Dubbo, Orange, Broken Hill and Northern Rivers. Students in the Dubbo Stream will undertake their places in Dubbo Hospital and further remote rural sites. There are only 24 places available for the Dubbo Stream, only available for domestic students who indicate their interest. Indigenous and rural applicants will be preferenced for the Dubbo Stream.

              in May - this is essentially a service to convert your academic transcript into the GPA that the university will use. Students will separately need to submit an application directly to the university, also in May. During this application process, students will be able to indicate their place preference and which stream (Metropolitan or Dubbo, or both) they wish to be considered for (note that only one offer will be made and transfers are not permitted). Within the application, Indigenous students can apply via the Indigenous Facilitated Admission Pathway (for students with a Bachelor degree and GAMSAT
              %sup ®

            %p
              Students must have attained a minimum GPA of 5.0/credit average. Rural and Indigenous applicants need a minimum GPA of 4.5 instead. The GPA must be calculated by UAC, i.e.

              and attain a minimum of 50 in each section. The largest new change is that an overall or average GAMSAT
              %sup ®
              score will not be used in the assessment and ranking of applicants. Instead, scores for each section of the GAMSAT
              %sup ®
              will be used to rank applicants. The university has not provided the exact method used to combine the sections and rank the applicants. As such, USyd advises that cut-offs of overall and average GAMSAT scores in previous years are irrelevant to the current admission cycle. International students may use MCAT
              %sup ®
              results instead, with a minimum score of 500 overall needed.

              Applicants who select consideration for the Dubbo Stream must also provide a personal statement as part of their application which demonstrates genuine interest, intention and aptitude for practising medicine in rural and regional areas.
            %p
              Another recent change is that interviews or the situational judgement test (SJT) are now generally not required, but may be sent to applicants in certain conditions, such as if they have previously been excluded or suspended from a course or professional registration, or if a tie-breaker is needed.
            %p
              There is assumed knowledge in anatomy, physiology and molecular/cellular biology. Regardless of their prior degree, students will need to complete an online Foundation Knowledge Course including a self-assessment after accepting their offer and before commencing studies.
            %h4 Selection Process
            %p
              Offers will be made based on academic performance, i.e. a combination of rankings from each section of the GAMSAT
              %sup ®
              , given that the GPA hurdle has been met. Offers for the Metropolitan Stream will be in sequence commencing with the applicant with the highest ranked score. Offers for the Dubbo Stream will be in sequence commencing with Indigenous applicants and Australian rural applicants with the highest ranked scores, after reviewing personal statements. If ranked equally, students may be asked to sit an interview or situational judgement test as an additional tool.

The first 18 months of the UoW medical program are completed within the allocated campus, and after that, students will be rotated through campuses and other regional, rural and remote areas of NSW. At the time of application through GEMSAS, applicants will need to specify the types of places in preferred offer and note a preference for Wollongong or Shoalhaven campus. Offers will be according to applicant rank and preference. Transfer between campuses is not allowed - if the campus is declined, the offer will be withdrawn.

              \. This can be completed in the metropolitan campus of Newcastle (UoN) or the rural campus of Armidale (UNE), with six clinical schools spread throughout the Central Coast and Hunter regions. The length of study for this degree is 5 years full time, split between a Bachelor of Medical Science in years 1-3 and a Doctor of Medicine in years 4-5. Students will therefore graduate with a BMedSci/MD.

              The combined degree is based in Adelaide’s North terrace campus. However, enrollment requires students to undertake rural clinical placements - CSP (both BMP and non-BMP) students need to complete four weeks of rural placements before graduate, with 25% of students required to complete one year of clinical training in a rural site.

              There will be 137 domestic places and 36 international fee paying places offered. This factors in 28.5% of the overall domestic places being allocated a BMP. Applications are made through SATAC in September, with separate SATAC codes for BMP and non-BMP places (students may apply for both). There are specific quotas for different groups of applicants:

It is designed for students who have completed their year 12 studies no more than 2 years prior, and have not commenced any other studies at a tertiary level during that time. Applicants who have commenced tertiary study are ineligible to apply and should consider the graduate entry program. The first two years of the program are completed on campus, and the final three years are hospital and community based across metro and rural Victoria. There are options for students to extend their studies by completing either an Honours program to the Bachelor of Medical Science, or a Master of Public Health.

              is based in Townsville, Queensland, and offers a pathway to undergraduate medicine through its Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS). This is a 6 year degree, with the first 3 years based in Townsville and the next 3 years including the chance to undertake placements throughout Northern Queensland including Cairns and Mackay. Extra Honours study is also available if students wish to develop a personal research project and thesis - at the end of year 4, students who have obtained grades in the top 25% of their cohort will be given the opportunity to enrol.

              James Cook University accepts around 150 students each year. Candidates must apply by September via both QTAC and an internal application form which includes a written portfolio component. A Prediction of Academic Achievement form must also be received by the university in early October. International students must submit a specific internal form in August, and Indigenous students must submit an Alternate Entry Pathway application and contact the Indigenous Education and Research Centre.

              Majority of places to the MBBS are given to high school leavers - that is, students who have completed year 12 within the last 2 years. There are pre-requisite subjects: all of English (Units 3/4, C), Mathematical Methods (Units 3/4, C), and Chemistry (Units 3/4, C), or their interstate/overseas equivalents. In addition, the study of physics and biology is highly desirable.

              The university does not release minimum academic thresholds. However, they have released student profiles as per commencement in Semester 1, 2021 - the highest ATAR was 99.90, the median ATAR was 98.55, and the lowest ATAR was 87.50. A very limited number of places are offered to non-school leavers - academic scores will be based on the most recent course GPA, with a minimum GPA of 5.75 needed to be considered for an interview.

                  Bond University
              is the only private university that offers a medical pathway, meaning that places are not subsidised by the government. The pathway is offered as a combined Bachelor of Medical Studies (BMedSt) and Doctor of Medicine (MD). The BMedSt cannot be completed as an independent degree, and the MD cannot be completed without first completing the BMedSt. Bond University is based in Robina on the Gold Coast, with clinical sites located near the main campus.
            %p
              Bond University is structured using trimesters, and as such, the degree can be completed in 4 years and 8 months (14 trimesters, though they are still referred to as semesters), making it technically the shortest pathway to becoming a doctor in Australia. The BMedSt runs over 8 semesters, or 2 years and 8 months, and the MD runs over 6 semesters, or 2 years. There are 2 starting points for the BMedSt - May and September.
            %p
              As described, there are no CSPs available for the program. Program fees are therefore all full fee paying - in 2022, program fees are $29 420 per semester, over the 14 semesters. Students are required to pay their first semester’s fee when accepting their offer, with future fees due at the start of each semester. FEE-HELP is available, but students should note that the maximum entitlements are not sufficient to meet the full tuition costs. One Indigenous student will be awarded a 50% scholarship.
            %p
              Direct entry into BMedSt is only open to domestic students. There are approximately 120 places offered for May commencement, and 60 places offered for September commencement. Of these places, approximately 80% are reserved for undergraduate applicants and 20% are reserved for graduate applicants. Undergraduate applicants refer to students who are either year 12 school leavers or who have commenced a tertiary degree. This includes students who are applying for Lateral Entry. Lateral Entry is open to current students and graduates of specific Bond University programs with a minimum GPA of 3.0/4.0 (Bond grading), with successful applicants moving straight into year 2 of the BMedSt. This is the only pathway available for international students. In 2021, 13 places were released to Lateral Entry students. Graduate applicants refer to students who have completed a tertiary degree within 9 years - admission is based on GPA, and students will need to start from the first year of the BMedSt. Both undergraduate and graduate applicants must complete the admission requirements described below.

In 2021, approximately 700 eligible applicants were invited to complete the psychometric test. The results of the psychometric test will form the basis for interview selection. In 2021, approximately 400 applicants were shortlisted and invited to attend the interview. Final selection is based on interview results only.
