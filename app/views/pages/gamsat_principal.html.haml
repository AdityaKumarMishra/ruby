              %p GradReady was founded on the belief that "there has to be a better way". We saw the opportunity to make learning more effective and efficient through doing something new and different. It is this change-for-better attitude that we would like to encourage in all applicants of the GradReady Principal’s Scholarship.
              %p We would like to help build a culture where people are encouraged to look for novel solutions, to think outside the box and to leverage and build upon the amazing tools of this new information age.
