              %p GradReady was founded on the belief that "there has to be a better way". We saw the opportunity to make learning more effective and efficient through doing something new and different. It is this change-for-better attitude that we would like to encourage in all applicants of the GradReady Principal’s Scholarship.
              %p We would like to help build a culture where people are encouraged to look for novel solutions, to think outside the box and to leverage and build upon the amazing tools of this new information age.
              %p One of the main challenges we will face in the coming decades is the provision of adequate healthcare to the aging population in the developed world and the expanding population in the developing world. As a prospective medical student and future clinician, you will be leading the efforts to address this challenge - through pioneering new tools and methods.
              %p We've partnered with various Secondary Schools all around Australia to provide their students with exclusive scholarships to help drive our vision and help you take the first step in becoming part of the solution.
