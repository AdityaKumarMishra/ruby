          The University Clinical Aptitude Test or UCAT
          %sup ®
          is a standardised computer-based test used as a criteria by many Australian universities for entry into undergraduate medical, dental and clinical science programmes. The two-hour long exam is delivered at Pearson VUE test centres and assesses a range of abilities and behaviours that these programs have identified as important towards practicing medicine and dentistry. It should be noted that the UCAT
          %sup ®
          exam is just one cog in the various components of a medical school application which typically includes academic qualifications and an interview process.
        %p
          The ultimate rationale for the UCAT
          %sup ®
          exam is to assist in identifying the best applicants out of the already extremely competitive cohort of medical or dental school candidates. For candidates applying for 2022 entry, the testing cycle will be run between July 1 and August 11,  2021.

          The first four subtests are considered cognitive subtests whereas Situational Judgement is often separated as a non-cognitive subtest. As such, the first four scores are often added up to give a final score out of 3600 with the score of the situational judgement test being left separate for universities to determine whether or not they will allow the score to contribute towards their application process. Note as well that throughout the exam around 10% of the exam questions are unscored

          that don’t count towards the final score.

          exam is scored based on the number of correct answers with no negative marking for incorrect answers. In other words, your performance on one question won’t affect the marking of any other question.

          Upon sitting the exam, results are emailed to you within 24 hours with instructions on how to find your score report via your Pearson VUE online account. These results are only valid for one year (i.e. 2021 UCAT
          %sup ®
          exam results are only valid for 2021 applications/entry into university in 2022). Note that there is no need to provide your results to the universities you are applying to as the UCAT

          What constitutes a competitive UCAT
          %sup ®
          score depends on a variety of factors such as the difficulty of the test in any given year, which universities you’re planning to apply for, as well as other admissions factors like your academic scores and interview performance.
        %p
          The average total score (50th percentile) in 2020 was 2520, which provides a fair approximation of what the average candidate would score. Broadly speaking, a competitive UCAT
          %sup ®
          percentile is the 90th percentile, which essentially means you’ve placed in the top 10% of applicants. In the 2020 testing cycle, this equated to a score of 2920. As the Situational Judgement Test scores are counted separately from the cognitive subtests, the mean Situational Judgement Test score was 592 in 2020.

          There’s no doubt that the UCAT
          %sup ®
          is a challenging exam, designed to differentiate the already competitive pool of medical and dental school applicants. However, one of the main reasons that students find the UCAT
          %sup ®
          exam difficult is not always the questions themselves, but rather the sheer number of questions - 233 questions in 2 hours, or to put it another way, a question every 31 seconds!
        %p
          Many students fail to finish the exam at all due to the intense time pressure, needing to complete 2 MCQs every minute. In addition to a high level of concentration and strong cognitive skills, the UCAT
          %sup ®
          exam requires exceptional time-management to do well.
        %p
          As such, preparation is key and preparing for the UCAT
          %sup ®
          exam  requires consistent practice over time and a targeted approach towards identifying strengths and weaknesses. Preparation can be broken down into a few key steps:

              In order to properly prepare for the UCAT
              %sup ®
              exam, it is important to first understand its importance in the medical school applications process. For many universities, the UCAT
              %sup ®
              score carries as much weight in your application as your ATAR. To put this into perspective, the total sum of Year 12 examinations and the intense hours of study behind these scores has as much importance as the score from the 2 hour long UCAT
              %sup ®
              exam. Even with a phenomenal ATAR or even a star performance at the interview, a poor UCAT

It’s important to acknowledge as well that students will often have varying strengths and weaknesses and it’s important to work out early which sections are going to play to your strengths, and which sections will require the most improvement.

        %h3 Extenuating Circumstances
        %p
          If you feel unwell before your exam, be sure to reschedule it to a later date by contacting Pearson VUE Customer Services (AU: 1800 512 320; NZ: 0800 451 260). You can reschedule up to 24 hours before your appointment time. If you miss the deadline for rescheduling, you will need to pay a further fee to re-book your test.
        %p
          When rescheduling your test, you still need to give the appropriate amount of notice even though the Pearson VUE Customer Services helpline is only available Monday to Friday from 9am to 6pm (local time). For example, if your appointment is on a Monday, in order to reschedule you will need to call Pearson VUE Customer Services before 6pm (local time) on the preceding Friday.
        %p
          Rescheduling is subject to the availability of appointments. In some circumstances you may need to travel to another location if there are no available appointments at your preferred test location. You cannot cancel or reschedule an appointment by email.
        %p
          If you miss your test without rescheduling, this will be considered as a ‘no show’ and you will be ineligible for a refund. A standard test fee is charged upon re-booking the test.
        %p
          If you feel unwell in the middle of the exam, notify the invigilator for this to be considered as a mitigating circumstance. In this case, you will have to reschedule your exam for a later date. The same goes for if you experience a hardware/software problem during the exam.
        %p
          If you present yourself for the test, you are declaring yourself fit to sit the exam. Thus, if you don’t feel as though you are able to sit the exam, you should reschedule or cancel. As such, it is recommended not to schedule your exam too late in the testing period in the case of such extenuating circumstances.
