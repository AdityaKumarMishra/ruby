            Ready classes are delivered to maximize a student’s learning capacity by focusing on the skills that need to be taught face to face. We do not waste our class time by providing you with basic information. Rather we provide access to fundamental knowledge and concepts through our online resources prior to classes. This allows our teachers to use their face to face time with students to ensure that students understand how to apply information in the context of example assessment questions. By allowing time between our face to face classes, we provide students with the opportunity to independently build their own knowledge so that they are able to focus their time with our tutors on the areas that challenge them the most.
            / We believe in the value of classroom interaction and
            / %a.u-red-link{:href => dynamic_product_version_uri('online-basic', 'HSC', 'english', 'feature-attendance')} learning through understanding and application

            Our courses are designed to assist students in maximizing the results they gain from the time they spend studying. We understand that each student has limited time to dedicate to study for each subject. Therefore, our online resources allow a student to identify their areas of strengths and weaknesses and then locate material for their needs using our Cross Referencing system. Our face to face learning experience, with small student groups, also ensures that students get the benefit of tutor assist to further hone in their skills and understanding of complex ideas and concepts.
            / A key to effective learning is knowing how to identify and work on your weaknesses. Unlike traditional paperback MCQ banks, our Online MCQ System tracks your performance and

            teaching, we make learning accessible and convenient. Students can tailor their learning experience by selecting the style of resource that suits them. We facilitate this by offering a variety of online learning resources including web based text guides, practice exams, videos and forum discussions. Students can connect with other students and have their questions answered by experienced and knowledgeable tutors. Students also benefit from the flexibility of an online learning environment so that they can study at their own pace. Our online tools are under constant review and we allow for students to give feedback and ask questions about the resources that we have available.

            GradReady was founded in 2010 by a group of University of Melbourne medical
            students. Our original aim was to help students in their GAMSAT
            %sup{ style: "margin-right: -4px;"} ®
            (Graduate Australian Medical School Admissions Test) preparation. We had found existing GAMSAT
            %sup{ style: "margin-right: -4px;"} ®
            courses to be overly didactic, inattentive to differing student needs, and lacking in online tools. Using our experience in education and IT, and leveraging the expertise of former lecturers at University of Western Australia and University of Otago, we founded GradReady, an education provider that is in sync with evolving educational philosophies.
          %p
            By the end of 2014, our first program – GAMSAT
            %sup{ style: "margin-right: -4px;"} ®
            Ready - had become the most widely used GAMSAT
            %sup{ style: "margin-right: -4px;"} ®
            preparation program with over 1000 students each year. Moreover, we were able to help our students achieve many milestones, including an average rise in percentile ranking of 25 percentage points and 100% medical school admission rate for our 2014 InterviewReady students.
          %p Subsequently, we asked ourselves - “can our advanced tools and methods help to bring the same level of success to High School Students?” The answer was a resounding yes

            In response, we created  – HSC
            %sup{ style: "margin-right: -4px;"} ®
            Ready – with the aim of bringing the same success stories to HSC
