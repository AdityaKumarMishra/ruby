                    Our teaching strategy focusses on learning through collaborative and targeted discussions with knowledgeable tutors in a classroom environment. In our classes we work through questions and focus on the application of knowledge rather than simply memorizing facts. Our videos and other pre-course material explain fundamental concepts to students. This allows our excellent teachers to focus on skills development and exam strategies in class time. Our classes are delivered over three weeks to allow students to maximize their learning experience and reflect upon their progress.

                    Our online resources allow students to identify their areas of strengths and weaknesses by engaging in effective diagnostic assessment through online MCQâ€™s. Students are then able to use our Cross Referencing system to access material that develops their areas of weaknesses and reinforces their strengths. For students who prefer to access information visually or by practice, we offer both video resources and the ability to tailor online practice exams to your own needs and standard. In addition to this, our tutors focus on delivering classes that develop micro skills such as the ability to analyses, compare and critique information.

                    Our HSC Ready classes are delivered to maximize a studentâ€™s learning capacity by focusing on the skills that need to be taught face to face. We do not waste our class time by providing you with basic information. Rather we provide access to fundamental knowledge and concepts through our online resources prior to classes. This allows our teachers to use their face to face time with students to ensure that students understand how to apply information in the context of example assessment questions. By allowing time between our face to face classes, we provide students with the opportunity to independently build their own knowledge so that they are able to focus their time with our tutors on the areas that challenge them the most.

                    Our courses are designed to assist students in maximizing the results they gain from the time they spend studying. We understand that each student has limited time to dedicate to study for each subject. Therefore, our online resources allow a student to identify their areas of strengths and weaknesses and then locate material for their needs using our Cross Referencing system. Our face to face learning experience, with small student groups, also ensures that students get the benefit of tutor assist to further hone in their skills and understanding of complex ideas and concepts.
