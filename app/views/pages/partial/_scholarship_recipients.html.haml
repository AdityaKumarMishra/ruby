        %p
          From an early age I’ve had many different interests. Growing up in Alice Springs, sport became a huge part of my life, and cricket was eventually the sport that took over all the others. After moving to boarding school in Adelaide to pursue cricket further, I was lucky enough to find myself representing South Australia in the national Future’s League competition in my first year of University. Since then, I’ve had to balance cricket commitments with university, as well as working as a resident assistant and Indigenous mentor at a secondary school. All the while working towards my aspirations to help people in areas of poverty and disaster. Through a passion for all of these interests paired with perseverance and discipline, I’ve been able to succeed in each of these pursuits, and these qualities are what I hope will bring me similar success in studying medicine.
        %p
          Having a passion for Indigenous education from my experiences in Alice Springs, working as an Indigenous student mentor in Adelaide has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Yet in my eyes there were drastic improvements that could be made to my School’s current program. This year I was lucky enough to win a fellowship from the school in order to rewrite the Indigenous education program with the hope to increase the wellbeing of students and achieve greater success in closing the gap in educational outcomes.

          During 2015 I found myself in Nepal during the devastating earthquake that shook the country to its knees. Within this tragic situation I realised why I’d always been drawn to a career in medicine. I found myself completely helpless to help all those in need in any significant way. The experience of seeing doctors being able to help all those who’d been devastated in the wake of the tragedy opened my eyes to the fact that in matters of life and death, being a doctor is one of the most meaningful ways to help people when they need it most.
        %p
          From my different experiences around the world, I’ve learnt that we are all extremely lucky to live in a country like Australia. We have opportunities here that are a privilege, and I feel as though it is up to us to help those in need that find themselves in situations of disadvantage; whether that be abroad or on our own doorstep. My passion for helping others, and discipline and perseverance to constantly pursue success, are qualities that I hope will lead me to be successful in making the most of these opportunities, and help those who need it most through a career in medicine.

        %h5 What drives you?
        %p
          An innate desire to push myself to achieve my full potential and not waste any opportunities, has driven me to strive for success in everything I do. Being from a refugee family that arrived in Australia in the 1970s, my family’s sheer hard work allowed them, and eventually myself, to have opportunities that are an absolute privilege, not a right, such as studying at university and pursuing what interests me with freedom. My grandparents’ unbelievable hard work inspires me to push myself every day to make the most of these opportunities that I have been lucky enough to be given.
      .col
        %h5 What do you hope to achieve in 20 years?
        %p
          In 20 years I hope to be established as a registered specialist in emergency medicine or a general surgeon. I hope that I’d have helped those patients in rural and remote areas of Australia and impoverished areas of the world. I aspire to work for Doctors without Borders in disaster zones and areas of extreme poverty, and in the healthcare of refugees, who desperately need greater support. Having seen first-hand the discrepancies between major centres and the rural communities of Australia from a healthcare perspective, I also aspire to become a leader in reducing this inequality through working in these areas and ensuring they are not forgotten by the rest of the medical community.

        %h5 What qualities would you say you have consistently demonstrated throughout your life?
        %p
          My drive and determination to continue to learn and expand my knowledge in a range of areas has always been present in my life. From the time before I went to school I was already asking my parents to put me in classes! I had an innate gift and love for art which drove me to bargain for extra art lessons whenever I could. I learnt to read before I started school and books always offered me an amazing escape from the real world as a child. I always seemed to be reading.
        %p
          When I started school I developed another passion which had been brewing, the love of maths and science. I found maths fun and would do equations as a pastime. When in year 5 at school, my teacher gave me the opportunity to do some year 6 work, I revelled in this and ended up jumping a year. The following year my dad unexpectedly passed away in traumatic circumstances and left me unable to complete year 7 and year 8. When I started back at school in year 9 I was nearly 2 years behind my classmates. However, I caught up within a few months and then excelled academically by receiving an offer to be part of the GATE (Gifted And Talented Education) Academic Extension program. I was also part of the GATE Visual Arts program and went to school every Saturday to do art. However, I still suffered from debilitating conditions and given a relapse during year 12 I was unable to attend school but completed my studies at home and still graduated (but without an ATAR score).
        %p
          I started a fine arts degree that I got into through portfolio pathway, however, I soon began to miss maths and science. I never understood society dictating that one must choose either art or science. I am now completing my psychology degree as it provides a good mix, however, I am very interested to expand on the biological aspect of mental illness and its connection with co-morbid physical conditions. I believe we should never stop learning. And most importantly, never lose the love of learning.
        %p
          I have always been a good leader and public speaker. I hold my dad responsible for this as he was heavily involved in politics and would take me to rallies and political party meetings as a child. He was a full blown hippy from the 60s! I have this deep commitment to social justice installed in me from an early age and have expanded this to being an executive committee member for the University of Western Australia People for Animal Welfare club and debating captain in high school. I competed in speaking competitions in high school such as the UN Youth Voice and managed the inter-school debate competitions. I am a life long vegetarian despite coming from a farming family and believe in the ethical and health reasons behind a plant-based diet. In the future I want to be a leader and advocate for the promotion of child/adolescent mental health and be able to address the shortage of resources and government funding in this area. In particular, to increase access to services in rural areas.
        %p
          I am a very independent person. Coming from a rural family background, a strong work ethic has been drilled into me from an early age and I have been working in some capacity since I was 14. This year at 19 I moved out and fully support myself financially by working 25 hrs a week in a professional job while studying full time. When I worry about the difficulty of medicine I tell myself that if I am able to do this I can probably handle the work required of medical school and future registrar training. Despite this, I constantly want to improve my qualities as perfection is nonexistent and it is so important to continue to grow as a person.
      .col
        %h5 What drives you?
        %p
          I currently work as a Behavioural Therapist (BT) with autistic children and have learnt so much through this experience. The work is very challenging but is so worth it to see the improvement in family and child functioning. The decision to apply for medicine is something many people I know are surprised at. I am on a definite pathway to becoming a psychologist and my fellow BTs are mostly provisional psychologists already. However, I feel drawn to medicine. I want to be able to look at and investigate physical illness as well as mental illness and be able to provide biological treatment as well as psychotherapy. I have so many varied interests in the area of health that I believe being a psychologist may not provide the full scope that I’m looking for. I do however believe that psychology is a very valued profession and I would be proud to call myself a psychologist if medicine does not work out.
      .col
        %h5 What do you hope to achieve in 20 years?
        %p
          In 20 years I hope to have completed all my subspecialty training in Child/Adolescent Psychiatry and Consult-Liaison Psychiatry or the Dual Fellowship program in Paediatrics and Child/Adolescent Psychiatry with particular expertise in child/adolescent psychosomatic medicine and neuropsychiatry. I want to be at the interface of mind-brain-body. There are not enough child psychiatrists out there and I hope to be one of the first to sub-specialise in the link between child mental health and diseases such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), irritable bowl syndrome (IBS), autoimmune disfunction and neurological disease.
        %p
          I hope my passion for both the arts and sciences will come together to provide a complete holistic approach in the treatment of my patients. I hope to never lose sight of how important every single detail is in working with children and young people. I hope that one day I might make a research discovery that will create a positive difference and to share my knowledge through teaching. I also hope to achieve one of life’s most difficult but rewarding challenges; having a family of my own.

          exam for the first time in March this year. I was happy to pass in my overall score but I did get slightly under 50 for SIII which is no surprise since I hadn’t studied chem/bio/physics since year 10. I am certain that with some structured teaching in these areas and some support to refine the humanities sections I will get a score that will hopefully get me an interview next year. I would never have been able to afford a course like this and am so grateful for this opportunity.

        %h5 What qualities would you say you have consistently demonstrated throughout your life?
        %p
          My childhood was consumed by a passion for dance. This reached a pinnacle at age 14 when
          I took the initiative to move away from home to study ballet in Sydney fulltime. During this
          time I completed my academic years 9 and 10 via correspondence however upon completion
          of  year  10, I was required to  choose  between  ballet  and  academics. Knowing that I would
          always be able to return to study and that a dancing career would not offer the same luxuries,
          I  chose  ballet. I  was  determined  to  achieve my  aspiration  of  gaining fulltime  employment
          with  a ballet  company within the next few years. Following several setbacks  and moments
          that truly tested my desire  and resilience, I  achieved my goal  and was  accepted to join the
          Queensland Ballet Company. Like most of my successes in life, I predominantly attribute this
          success to tenacity and perseverance; two qualities I believe I have consistently demonstrated
          throughout my life and qualities I believe will allow me to be successful in future endeavours.
        %p
          In  2011,  after  a  successful  4­years  fulltime  employment  with  the  Queensland  Ballet
          Company, I fractured my spine and suffered from other associated complications forcing my
          retirement. Having immersed myself in the world of dance since  age 3, I was unsure  as to
          what  my  next  career  direction  should  be.  Determined  to  not  let  this  injury  define  me,  I
          contacted  universities  and  TAFE,  attended  meetings  with  academic  advisors  and  course
          coordinators, attended mature age entry workshops and information seminars, and sat several
          exams  that  eventually  resulted  in  me  completing  the  Adult  Tertiary  Preparation  course  at
          TAFE. Due to the initiative I demonstrated during this crossroads, I am now nearing the end
          of my undergraduate degree and about to embark on a journey that I am sure will once again
          test my resilience, tenacity and perseverance­ my journey to medicine.
      .col
        %h5 What drives you?
        %p
          I have lived  a very exciting  and full life that has provided me with more opportunities  and
          experiences than most people my age. I have travelled the world and achieved many of my
          dreams but have also experienced times of hardship, sickness and non­successes. I have learnt
          that sickness is horribly scary, and as a patient you completely and whole­heartedly entrust
          your  health  with  your  doctor.  Because  of  these  experiences  I  have  grown  to  believe  that
          becoming a doctor is a vocation that if carried out with empathy and selflessness, can allow
          you  to  have  a  meaningful  and  positive  impact  on  the  lives  of  others,  a  vocation I  believe
          would be immensely rewarding. It is this gratification that I feel is driving me to be successful
          in my future aspirations of being a doctor.

        %h5 What do you hope to achieve in 20 years?
        %p
          In 20 years time I hope to have  achieved my registration  as  a medical specialist. I hope to
          have  positively  impacted  the  lives  of many  patients  and  their families  and I  hope  to  have
          accomplished this by adopting a more holistic approach than is commonly utilised by current
          medical practitioners. Further to this,  coming from  a regional town in New South Wales, I
          have  experienced  the  divide  in  accessibility  to  specialist  medical  care  between  rural  and
          metropolitan areas and as such, hope to contribute to bridging this gap in years to come.

          the application process. I walked out of the exam, not so much daunted by the process, but
          more  eager to  begin studying for the  next  exam,  as I  believed furthering my  essay writing
          skills and increasing my knowledge of chemistry could improve my score.

        %p
          Key  attributes,  abilities  and  personal  strengths  in  leadership  that  I  have  consistently
          demonstrated  throughout  my  life  are  integral  as  a  medical student  and  as  a  future  doctor
          leading  a  medical  team.  Having  seen  the  genuine  interest  of  doctors  in  their  cases  and
          motivation,  highlighted  to  me  the  privilege  of  being  involved  in  such  a  rewarding  and
          stimulating  profession.  I  am  confident  that  my  enthusiasm,  extremely  high  work  ethic,  and
          thirst for knowledge are needed to succeed in this fulfilling vocation.
        %p
          The  healthcare  patients receive today  is  built  on  years  of  clinical research.  As  a result,  I  am
          currently  lead author  in four research papers;  in addition, several other small side projects. I
          have  successfully  presented  my  different  areas  of  clinical  research  as  oral  and  poster
          presentations  at  various  conferences  around  Australia.  I  trust  my  experiences  and  research
          capabilities will provide an important basis to facilitate my learning during medical vocation but
          also during my medical career.
        %p
          The Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience (AIME) program is an inspiring new program
          proven  to  connect  indigenous  students  with  post  year  12  opportunities,  including  further
          education  and  employment.  As  an  active  member  and  a  mentor,  my  involvement  and
          experience has been highly satisfying and rewarding. This experience has cemented the need
          and  development  of  focused  leadership,  communication  skills  and  cultural  understanding.  I
          strongly believe that work done in the spirit of service yields the greatest outcomes and even
          greater is giving back to the community through acts of voluntary service. My involvement in
          the  AIME  program  enabled  me  to  give  back  to  the  community  by  assisting  in  building  a
          generation  of  future  leaders  who  strive  to  create  a  culture  where  for  every  step  you  take
          forward in life, you throw your hand back and bring someone with you.
        %p
          The Junior Youth Spiritual Empowerment Program (JYSEP) is another program that has enabled
          me to utilize my leadership skills while serving the Australian  community. My involvement  in
          the  JYSEP  assists  young  youth  (between  12‐18  years  of  age)  in  developing  their  spiritual
          qualities (virtues), intellectual capabilities and capacities for service to society. The participants
          in this program come to see that they can become positive agents of change in the world.
        %p
          I have always taken a great interest and initiative in students learning and education. In turn, I
          have  tutored  and  assisted  students  in  key  subject  areas  including;  pharmacotherapeutics,
          pharmacology and physiology. This has been a pivotal experience in developing my leadership
          skills  and  more  importantly,  supporting  students  to  follow  their  dreams  and  achieve  their
          future  goals.  I  look forward to  one  day  being  able to  assist future  clinicians  in their medical
          aspirations.
        %p
          Having spent a significant amount of my childhood in rural area (River Lands in South Australia)
          with  my  grandparents,  I  have seen  the shortage  of  health  professionals,  especially  in  more
          remote  indigenous  communities  nearby.  I  also feel that modern medicine should  attempt to
          bridge  the  gap  between  indigenous  and  non‐indigenous  Australians  in  terms  of  health
          conditions such as type 2 diabetes, chronic otitis media, rheumatic heart disease and lower life
          expectancy discrepancies. This has been further cemented through my involvement in the AIME
          program. I look forward to developing and providing the skills necessary to work within these
          areas and provide the services that are currently in short supply.

        %h5 What qualities would you say you have consistently demonstrated throughout your life?
        %p I critically think about situations that I come across, which allows me to understand the reasons behind them and brainstorm ideas on how to improve the way in which things could be done next time. I have a creative side and thrive on coming up with new ideas. I’ve inherited my parents' generosity, kindness and mathematical brain, which has me naturally learning towards community service and finding problems to fix.
        %p I have applied these qualities through leadership roles in work, sport and volunteering. Currently, I am involved in the establishment of a research facility within a retirement village, focussing on healthy ageing initiatives, including Dementia prevention. This facility not only contributes essential research data toward dementia prevention, but by through its location within a retirement village we are also bridging the gap between research outcomes and clinical practice in the ageing community. As this is a new research centre, we are doing the best we can to establish funding. We need to exercise our resourcefulness constantly to get what we need done, especially amidst our current $1.5 million dementia prevention clinical trial.
        %p I show initiative in all aspects of my life. I am a big believer in team-work and love team sport. My sport of choice for the past 5 years has been roller derby. l was lucky enough to progress to Team Australia try outs last year. Currently, I am founding a Roller Hockey league in Sydney and have organised a large group of skaters, coaches, the venue hire and training sessions. I saw the need for Roller Hockey in Sydney so I used my skills to help begin the budding of the sport in my town. Whilst a member of my Roller Derby league I questioned why we did not have an established first-aid committee for such a dangerous high contact sport and such a large group of skaters, sitting just under 100 people skating. I am now head of first-aid for the league and have established policy and protocol surrounding injuries, guided a group of twenty first-aid officers and facilitated their training and ongoing safety development through workshops where visitors are invited to present.
        %p I am constantly open to developing new qualities and continuously gaining insight and knowledge from new experiences. I am looking forward to the world of medicine combined with research where I will never stop learning and never stop being fascinated and humbled by the human body and mind.

        %h5 What drives you?
        %p I feel fulfilled when I see gaps in processes or problems that need fixing and then successfully getting them fixed. I enjoy possessing skills that can fix problems. I enjoy contributing to projects, organisations and the community. I love to be inspired, as this is when l have the most energy. People inspire me - everyone has a story and develops into their own complicated self. The human body is a complicated array of processes that can go wrong, I love that I will never know everything in medicine and science and that I will constantly be learning and building on my knowledge.

        %h5 What do you hope to achieve in 20 years?
        %p Currently, there is a lack of holistic care in medicine and a lack of translation from research outcomes to medical practice. Using my initiative, resourcefulness and ingenuity I am hoping to become a doctor and open a brain health clinic where patients will be treated and can connect with specialists in every field. I hope to help bridge many gaps in medicine through my own multi-functional clinic. Although the focus will be on the brain, this encompasses many fields such as nutrition, exercise, mental health, paediatrics, neonatal care, ageing, naturopathy, surgery and research - I want to encourage a collaborative approach to medicine and research. I also hope to use my qualifications and skills to contribute to disadvantaged communities, nationally and internationally, and use my leadership skills to guide and teach.

        %h5 What qualities would you say you have consistently demonstrated throughout your life?
        %p Up until now I have lived life based on the qualities that are most important to me, as they allowed me to get through the hardships of life. These qualities include resourcefulness, initiative, ingenuity and passion. Having a high regard for these qualities made me aware of the help my parents needed to conquer the economic hardship that we faced ten years ago when we arrived in Australia. After really understanding what the first few years of living in Australia were going to involve, I took action by being proactive in mainly minimising the financial burden I was to my parents. I then began to look for ways to help my parents financially. I sold caramel slices at the local football games (a great success) and l capitalised on this by selling hand-made jewellery along with the slices. I offered every dollar I made to my parents. Although my parents were always reluctant to take the money, it did help to pay for my school expenses (excursions, buying textbooks, uniforms, calculators and the yearly school photos).
        %p Although a nice gesture, $60 wasn't going to rip us out of poverty and seat us comfortably in a mansion. I felt I could do more. Learning English, although easy for me, was frustrating and spirit breaking for my parents. Seeing me progress in language gave my parents the inspiration to look for something more than just back breaking labour. Once I was fluent in English I was ready to pass on my knowledge to help them improve. I clearly wasn’t an English teacher but I found a way to help improve their English. Firstly, I simply encouraged the family to speak English at home. And secondly, I wrote English exams for them to sit every month, designed using templates of year 7-8 school English tests.
        %p My father is now applying for his Honours in Psychology and my mother is in a professional position in rural Australia.

        %h5 What drives you?
        %p I firmly believe that the last ten years have defined who I am today. Having experienced the hardships of moving to a foreign country and working towards where I am today, I have learned that with passion and perseverance one can always find the light at the end of the tunnel. I lived life based on these principles and this allows me to continue to follow my dreams, regardless of the obstacles along the way.

        %h5 What do you hope to achieve in 20 years?
        %p I hope to experience another twenty beautiful years of life, full of hope, learning, love and happiness. I would first like to travel the world and experience life amongst different cultures. I hope to finally be able to speak Portuguese within the next ten years (which I've always wanted), but most importantly, I hope to have achieved full registration as a doctor and be heading towards a career in paediatrics. Towards the end of the twenty years I hope to have a beautiful family of five.
