        GradReady was founded in 2010 by a group of University of Melbourne medical
        students. Our original aim was to help students in their GAMSAT
        %sup{ style: "margin-right: -5px;"} ®
        (Graduate Australian Medical School Admissions Test) preparation. We had found existing GAMSAT
        %sup{ style: "margin-right: -5px;"} ®
        courses to be overly didactic, inattentive to differing student needs, and lacking in online tools. Using our experience in education and IT, and leveraging the expertise of former lecturers at University of Western Australia and University of Otago, we founded GradReady, an education provider that is in sync with evolving educational philosophies.
      %p
        By the end of 2014, our first program – GAMSAT
        %sup{ style: "margin-right: -5px;"} ®
        Ready - had become the most widely used GAMSAT
        %sup{ style: "margin-right: -5px;"} ®
        preparation program with over 1000 students each year. Moreover, we were able to help our students achieve many milestones, including an average rise in percentile ranking of 25 percentage points and 100% medical school admission rate for our 2014 Interview Ready students.
      %p Subsequently, we asked ourselves - “can our advanced tools and methods help to bring the same level of success to High School Students?” The answer was a resounding yes
      %p
        In response, we created  – VCE
        %sup{ style: "margin-right: -5px;"} ®
        Ready – with the aim of bringing the same success stories to VCE
        %sup{ style: "margin-right: -5px;"} ®
        High Schoolers.

        Our VCE
