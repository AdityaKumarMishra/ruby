          GEMSAS (Graduate Entry Medical Schools Admissions System) acts as a single hub for applications to the ten medical schools that make up its members. It manages applications, calculates grade point averages (GPAs) and applies individual school selection rules to allocate and organise interview and course offers to candidates around Australia. For more details, you can visit
          %a{href: 'http://gemsas.edu.au/', target: :_blank}
            %strong their website.

        %p
          GEMSAS releases an Admissions Guide annually in around late April with all the policies and requirements for students looking to gain entry into a graduate-entry medical program in the following year. Students wanting to apply to graduate medical schools through GEMSAS should always read the most up-to-date guide, as it not only provides important information about how to lodge applications, but also provides a run down on the specific selection criteria and entry pathways for each GEMSAS graduate medical school.

          It’s important to note that your GAMSAT
          %sup ®
          Score only makes up one component of your application, and there are various other factors that need to be considered. For more information, you can refer to the section below on the different

          As always, it’s best to get in contact with the relevant medical institutions for further details and up-to-date information.

          %p
            You will receive a GAMSAT score for each section when results are released. This is not your raw score. You can think of the GAMSAT score as a scaled score or a numerical version of a percentile ranking. As it would be virtually impossible or impractical to write a precisely equivalent examination each year, your results are scaled to allow for comparison across different exam sittings. This is to ensure fairness across different sittings of the exam. You may hear other students talking about how one sitting was particularly difficult and another was seemingly easier - although this may be true, this will not affect the scores received precisely because they will be scaled against each other.
          %p
            The overall GAMSAT score is a weighted average of the three section scores. The following weightings are given to each section in determining your overall score:

          %ul.list_box.mbot20
            %li Overall Score = (1 x Section I + 1 x Section II + 2 x Section III) / 4

        %p In terms of using these cutoffs, although they’re able to provide a rough guide, it’s important to understand that it’s nigh impossible to predict the cutoff scores for this year due to the multitude of factors that go into determining these. For example consider the potential influence of the cohort itself:
        .highlight_box.hbox_font14
          %p.mtop_zero
            For example, let’s imagine a scenario where students based in Victoria all decided to avoid applying to medical schools interstate due a desire to avoid future interstate border shutdowns related to COVID-19. Students who may have previously preferenced medical schools interstate are now all preferencing Victorian medical schools. What will the cut-offs be for the University of Melbourne and Deakin University? Astronomical. How will it affect the cut-offs for other schools? Most likely raise all of them.
          %p.mtop_zero
            Additionally, medical schools tend to pool applicants who can and want to travel there to interview, so it skews the
            %a{href: "http://www.gemsas.edu.au/", target: "_blank"}
              %strong GEMSAS
            cutoffs year-to-year. In 2020 and 2021 many interviews were conducted online, skewing this trend, but some medical schools have begun to return to in-person interviews in 2021. In 2022 we may see a greater shift back to in-person interviews. It’s these year-to-year geographical nuances in scores and applications that make it near impossible to predict the GAMSAT
            %sup ®
            cutoffs for the next round of applications.

          The University of Western Australia has changed how they rank applicants for an offer. They now use the following weightings:  30% to GPA, 20% to GAMSAT® score and 50% to interview score. All scores will be standardised prior to ranking. In addition, it’s worth noting that rural applicants will be ranked based on a separate weighting structure: 22.5% to GPA, 15% to GAMSAT® score, 37.5% to interview score, and 25% to rural rating. There are few specific details provided regarding this rural rating, save for the following statement: The rurality score will be calculated on the most recent 5 years spent in a defined rural area (as per the rural eligibility definition).

Students must still meet a minimum score of 50 in each section (except for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander applicants). For the GPA, standard applicants will be required to have a minimum of 5, and rural applicants a minimum of 4.5.

The University will give these applicants due notice of any additional requirements. If further separation is required, the applicants' GPA at the time of application may be used, at the discretion of the University.

          So what does this mean? It’s difficult to say exactly as there have been some conflicting observations. With the interview requirement lifted, it would be reasonable to expect an increase in the GAMSAT cutoff scores - However, 2021 entry actually saw a drop in the student-reported cutoff scores from 69 to 66. That said, there was a subsequent increase to a student-reported cutoff score of 72 for 2022 entry. One possible reason for this fluctuation is the method used by USyd to rank students by each section of the GAMSAT
          %sup ®
          exam. As noted above, overall or average scores are not used, each section score is used separately and the way that these scores are combined is not provided. One potential hypothetical is that USyd may have shifted the weighting for the sections away from Section 3 with a greater emphasis on Section 1 or 2 or both to compensate for the removal of the interview, and this may explain the shift in cutoff scores. Another possibility is that they may have adjusted the method between 2021 entry and 2022 entry. Overall, the main takeaway is that students should consider cutoff scores from 2021 entry onwards as entirely separate from historic cutoff scores - These more recent scores are indicative of current trends and it’s likely we’ll get a clearer picture each year additional data is gathered.

The University will give applicants due notice of any additional requirements. MD applicants who have made applications for both the Metropolitan (Sydney) and Dubbo streams are advised that only one offer into the MD program will be made.

          In light of the significant disruptions and transition to online learning caused by COVID-19, many universities opted to change the way in which they graded assessments for 2020, with many universities moving to something akin to a pass/fail model. This had significant ramifications on the calculation of GPA scores and each university outlined their positions on GPA/WAM methodology for prospective GEMSAS applicants who completed their key/qualifying degree in 2020.

                    An applicant’s GPA will, subject to the exclusions below, be calculated on the most recent 3-FTE years of study of completed/completing degrees at AQF Level 7 or above. All grades/results (including fail grades, if applicable) from the most recent 3-FTE years of completed/completing study will be used.

                    Some institutions have decided to change their grading system to pass/fail for either Semester One, 2020 or for the whole of 2020. These qualifications will still be accepted provided they remain a minimum three-year full-time equivalent (FTE) undergraduate degree, or other accepted qualifying degree.

                    The GPA is calculated on the most recent three full-time-equivalent years (FTE) of study (e.g. 3 FTE is 144 credit points at UWA). Please note this excludes any exemptions, credit or advanced standing.

                    As a temporary measure due to impacts of COVID-19, all results obtained from studies undertaken during Semester 1 2020, and concurrent non-standard study periods, were treated as ungraded pass/fail in the HMS GPA calculation. As the impact from this period on the overall GPA has lessened, the Selection GPA calculation will now treat results from this period as shown on the transcript.

                  %p 
                    The credit value/unit weighting of ungraded passes will count towards the three years of FTE study; however, the result itself is left out of the calculation. For example, if a student has 0.125 FTE of ungraded pass in a particular year, that year's HMS GPA will be based on 0.875 FTE of results. The exception is where an applicant has more than one year or FTE of ungraded passes within their most recent three years FTE. In this instance, the calculation will include results from older study where available.

                  %p 
                    Both the result and credit value/weighting of ungraded fails are included in the HMS GPA calculation. An ungraded fail will confer a GPA result of 0 for that unit.

          GPA Calculation
          %p
            Your GPA is a score out of 7.0 that is calculated using your marks throughout your previous studies. Your GPA does not need to be derived from a science degree, and excellence in other fields is equally recognised.

          %p
            Like the overall GAMSAT score, the different universities use slightly different formulas to calculate your GPA, and some only use your GPA as a hurdle. It is important that you have a look at how your GPA is calculated at the universities you wish to apply to, as this may carry significant weight as to how competitive you are depending on the differences. Most universities use a weighted GPA, meaning that your marks in your final year of study are worth more than your earlier marks.

          .highlight_box.mbot40
            %p.text-center
              The weighted GPA is calculated as follows:
            %ul.list_box.mbot20
              %li GPA = [((GPA Final - 2 years) x 1) + ((GPA Final - 1 year) x 2) + (GPA Final year x 3)] / 6
              %li.text-center.small_txt
                %span
                  The unweighted GPA is used by Griffith University and UWA, and is simply calculated using an average of the final 3 years of study:
              %li GPA = (GPA Final year - 2 years) + (GPA Final year - 1 year) + (GPA Final year) / 3
          %p
            UQ calculates GPA using a unique method which weights subjects by their credit value rather than the year in which the subjects were completed. For further details refer to the latest

The below table summarises the different types of postgraduate study and how they may be considered by different universities. Note that this table should not be taken as an exhaustive summary -  For example, some universities require you to have completed any postgraduate study by an earlier deadline compared to a bachelor’s degree. Students completing a bachelor’s degree can apply in their final year before their degree and results are finalised and receive a conditional offer. On the other hand, many universities require you to have completed a postgraduate degree by mid-year for it to be eligible for consideration in any GPA calculations. As always, the most accurate and up-to-date information is best found in the GEMSAS guide and from the universities themselves.

                  The University of Wollongong has an additional online test called CASPer. CASPer is an online video based scenario, situational judgement test and is designed to measure the personal and professional traits, such as ethics, empathy and communication and how these traits will be best suited towards a career in medicine. It will be used as a hurdle requirement for an interview offer. For the final medical school place offer, standardised interview/CASPer scores and portfolio scores are used to rank for offer, with equal weighting. GPA and GAMSAT results are not included in the formula after interview.

          Is it hard to get into Australian medical school?
        %p
          There’s no ignoring it - Getting into medical school in Australia is hard and competitive. As you would have learnt on this page, the application process itself is long and confusing, requiring you to excel in a wide array of fields and skills. Firstly, your GPA is generally taken into consideration, meaning that you have to have performed at a high level for the past three years of tertiary studies. You then have to sit the GAMSAT
          %sup ®
          = "- testing your humanities, writing and science skills - and not just pass the minimum threshold, but attain a competitive score. Some universities will even want you to submit a portfolio or complete prerequisite subjects. And once you’ve done everything you can to gain an interview offer, you also need to ace the interview itself as most universities use this as 50% of your overall score to gain an offer into medical school itself. It can be quite overwhelming, and it is undoubtedly an intense and difficult process. However, while it’s important to understand how the process works in order to make good decisions, it’s also equally important to look after yourself and do the best with what you have."

              incredible cut-off scores
          for the GAMSAT® exam seen for contemporary applications means that a re-sit of the exam and hopefully a corresponding score boost is often necessary to improve a student’s chances in the subsequent year. It is extremely difficult to rebound back into the GAMSAT
          %sup ®
          again, as it is such a draining affair. However, students should be comforted in the fact that they know what to expect, they have a better feel for what’s high-yield study, and they feel the pressure to motivate further revision. Read our page on

          Chances of getting into medical school
        %p
          Whilst the exact numbers of applicants are never released, we can estimate that there are over 10000 medical student hopefuls applying each year, with around 2000 spots up for grabs across the country. Whilst these odds may not seem to fall in your favour, it’s important to continue reminding yourself that there are still 2000 students each year who receive that beautiful acceptance letter. If medicine is something you truly want to study, the tough application process is worth it. Remember that GAMSAT
          %sup ®
          , GPA and interview performance (and portfolios) are all important - do not neglect one aspect of your application and hope that the others balance it out. Give everything your best shot, believe in yourself and trust the process.

        %p
          For example, some universities such as the University of Wollongong only use the GPA as a hurdle. Some universities will use a weighted GPA such that your final years of study will carry more weight than the first few years, whereas unweighted GPAs will equally spread the weight of each year of your studies - you can use this to your advantage depending on your position. And some universities will give you automatically boosted GPAs for completing higher degrees such as PhDs and Masters degrees.

        %p.mtop_zero
          There are three main types of graduate medical student ‘places’ in Australia. These are Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs), Bonded Medical Places (BMPs), and Full-Fee Paying Places (FFPs). The table below summarises what each means and who may be eligible. Students should always check with the universities and the GEMSAS guide for the most up-to-date information regarding the numbers and requirements for each type of place. There are other entry pathways that are not outlined in the table below, such as those for Indigenous Australians. This information is also provided by individual universities and in the GEMSAS guide.

        %h2#medical_school Medical School - What Does it Involve?
        %p.mtop_zero Whilst each graduate medical school in Australia is different, there are a few aspects about medical training that you can expect to experience if you become a medical student. After all, completing graduate medical training allows you to work as a doctor throughout the country.
        %p.mtop_zero Firstly, medical school can generally be split up into ‘pre-clinical’ and ‘clinical’ phases, referring to when learning is primarily university-based versus clinical placement-based.
        %p.mtop_zero In the pre-clinical phase, tutorials are often structured as problem-based learning. This means that classes will be guided and presented around an example of a patient scenario. Some universities will structure further learning around this, for example anatomy laboratories. Students will also need to learn the relevant communication and clinical skills for becoming a doctor, such as how to take a pain history or how to perform a cardiovascular examination. It is also common for students in their pre-clinical phase to have some exposure to clinical placements.
        %p.mtop_zero In the next phase, transitioning from learning in tutorials and lectures to the clinical environment can be challenging, but is nonetheless rewarding and develops important knowledge and skills.
        %p.mtop_zero Universities time their rotations differently, however generally students will spend the most time placed in the main specialties (general medicine, surgery, general practice etc.) and less in the more niche specialties. Universities also offer (or even mandate) rural clinical school training, where students can spend a period of their course placed in a regional or rural area. There may also be options to attend elective placements interstate or overseas that students may organise themselves.

        %h2#ordr_pref How to Order your Preferences
        %p.mtop_zero It’s near impossible to conceive of a way in which you can ‘play the system’, in regards to GEMSAS preferencing. All offers are coordinated centrally via GEMSAS and if a medical school doesn’t want you, you’ll get passed onto your next preference for consideration. Below are some tips - Remember, don’t overthink it!
        %p.mtop_zero Each applicant’s eligibility and competitiveness will be assessed for their number one preference. If the applicant does not meet the requirements or is not highly ranked enough to gain an interview offer at their first preference, they will be assessed for their second preference. If the applicant is then not eligible or highly-ranked enough for their second, they will be assessed for their third and so on (until an interview offer is made or all preferences are exhausted).
        %p.mtop_zero After interviews, the above process will be repeated using interview scores in the calculations (according to each school’s selection rules). However, a student cannot be accepted for a graduate medical school position at a school that is higher on their preference list than the school they interviewed at. For example, if you complete an interview at your fourth preference school, your application for a final offer will be considered for your fourth, then if unsuccessful your fifth preference and so on. It will not be considered for your first, second, or third preferences in such a case.
        %p.mtop_zero
          Clearly, it is important to choose your preferences wisely. It is important to read carefully through this page and the GEMSAS admission guide - learn about how each university weighs its admission criteria and find where you may be more competitive. You may find that you have a lot of life experience and extracurricular activities that lend well to a university that uses a portfolio. Or if you find that you have a low GPA but a high GAMSAT
          %sup ®
          score, you may want to apply for universities that give greater weight to the GAMSAT
          %sup ®
          score in the calculation of your final score.
        %p.mtop_zero
          Ultimately, however, it is most important that you order your preferences based on where you actually want to study and where you will be the happiest. A medical degree requires a lot of time, energy and commitment, and you need to know that you will be comfortable with your decision, especially if it involves moving interstate.

          Below are some tips on how you might choose to order your preferences:
