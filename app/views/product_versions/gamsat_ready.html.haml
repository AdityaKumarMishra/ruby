                  I believe the videos tutorials were so useful for someone like me, who is in NZ, and could not physically attend the course. The feedback given on each and every question to explain why you got it correct or incorrect. Sitting the mock exam allowed me to have a better gauge of my speed of performance under exam conditions. The mock exam also made me feel slightly insecure about my ability in a few sections, so it motivated me to improve on those sections in my last few weeks.

                  Definitely improved my confidence in essay writing! The gradready book was amazing for section 3. Good amount of content covered for building up on basic science background.

                  It helped me develop my science knowledge and improved me from a 54 to a 71 in that section. The tutorials worked well to simplify the harder concepts for me and the multitude of practice questions made a big difference. I found the marked essays very helpful also.

                  The marked essays in particular were very helpful. At first I wasn't scoring highly but I received good feedback and learnt how to improve. The videos were good for chemistry and physics in particular - to learn the basic prerequisite knowledge. The MCQs were good for revising content as well.

                  Was great in terms of what to expect in how the exam was structured, however could've gone through more questions in the course and specifically why certain questions are right as a lot are very wordy

                  The thing I liked about the course was the large variety of practice questions. I also liked the markings of the essays, although the marks I did receive in the essays I did submit did not reflect on the marks I got in the exams.

                  Helped with essay feedback, needs more in terms of section 1 - reasoning in humanities. Sure, hundreds of questions are great, but tips on how to analyse texts and how to attempt the question would be useful.
