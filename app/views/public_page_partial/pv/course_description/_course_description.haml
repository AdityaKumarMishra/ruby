        InterviewReady will help you take that final step to medical school. Pioneered by Dr. Stuart Saunders, a former University of Western Australia lecturer in philosophy and a current doctor, InterviewReady is updated yearly - accurately reflecting the latest practices in medical admissions.
        3 years in a row, InterviewReady has produced an amazing over

        for its attendees. This unparalleled achievement is made possible by a detailed analysis by the GradReady team on the MMI process and how each student measures up against the process. Firstly, the MMI black box is demystified by a comprehensive breakdown and discussion of various important scenarios in our small interaction-orientated classes of 16. Moreover, you will then attend the most realistic mock-MMI available in Australia and be given detailed feedback of your performance at each station. In accordance with the post Covid updates made by most universities – the GradReady mock-MMIs now run online in most locations to best simulate what you will experience in the real interview. All of your interviewers will be successful medical students who thoroughly understand why each scenario is relevant to the lives of doctors.

        Like our InterviewReady Comprehensive package, the Essentials package contains all the useful tips and advice. We will still ensure that the MMI is demystified by someone who understands the process. The only difference between the 2 courses is that the Mock MMI day will be replaced by a tutor facilitated peer-run MMI day, which was the traditional MMI training model - until GradReady introduced its model, which achieved an amazing

        Despite the success of our Comprehensive package, we recognise that not every student is able to fund the cost of having 10 staff and 8 rooms needed for the Mock MMI day. Therefore we have created the Essentials package to provide some key pieces of information and opportunities for monitored practise.
