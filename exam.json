But he who works for sweetness and light united, works to make reason and the will of God prevail. He who works for machinery, he who works for hatred, works only for confusion. Culture looks beyond machinery, culture hates hatred; culture has but one great passion, the passion for sweetness and light. Yes, it has one yet greater!&mdash; the passion for making them prevail. It is not satisfied till we all come to a perfect man; it knows that the sweetness and light of the few must be imperfect until the raw and unkindled masses of humanity are touched with sweetness and light. If I have not shrunk from saying that we must work for sweetness and light, so neither have I shrunk from saying that we must have a broad basis, must have sweetness and light for as many as possible. Again and again I have insisted how those are the happy moments of humanity, how those are the marking epochs of a people&#39;s life, how those are the flowering times for literature and art and all the creative power of genius, when there is a national glow of life and thought, when the whole of society is in the fullest measure permeated by thought, sensible to beauty, intelligent and alive.

Plenty of people will try to indoctrinate the masses with the set of ideas and judgments constituting the creed of their own profession or party. Our religious and political organisations give an example of this way of working on the masses. I condemn neither way; but culture works differently. It does not try to teach down to the level of inferior classes; it does not try to win them for this or that sect of its own, with ready-made judgments and watchwords.

Hatred, in Arnold&#39;s characterisation, is aligned with confusion, whereas the author&#39;s use of&nbsp;&#39;hate&#39; is better understood as further articulating the dichotomy outlined in the sentence containing the statement.

Five white geese, taking the air this fine morning, even as they were doing, met them in the way. They hesitated, cackled; then, converting their lifted necks into rigid, horizontal snakes, they rushed off in disorder, hissing horribly as they went. Red calves paddled in the dung and mud of a spacious yard. In another enclosure stood the bull, massive as a locomotive. He was a very calm bull, and his face wore an expression of melancholy stupidity. He gazed with reddish-brown eyes at his visitors, chewed thoughtfully at the tangible memories of an earlier meal, swallowed and regurgitated, chewed again. His tail lashed savagely from side to side; it seemed to have nothing to do with his impassive bulk. Between his short horns was a triangle of red curls, short and dense.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Splendid animal,&quot; said Henry Wimbush. &quot;Pedigree stock.

The spectacle of so much crude life is refreshing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear you say so,&quot; Gombauld broke in warmly. &quot;Lots of life: that&#39;s what we want. I like pullulation; everything ought to increase and multiply as hard as it can.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gombauld grew lyrical. Everybody ought to have children&mdash;Anne ought to have them, Mary ought to have them&mdash;dozens and dozens. He emphasised his point by thumping with his walking-stick on the bull&#39;s leather flanks. Mr. Scogan ought to pass on his intelligence to little Scogans, and Denis to little Denises. The bull turned his head to see what was happening, regarded the drumming stick for several seconds, then turned back again satisfied, it seemed, that nothing was happening. Sterility was odious, unnatural, a sin against life. Life, life, and still more life. The ribs of the placid bull resounded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standing with his back against the farmyard pump, a little apart, Denis examined the group. Gombauld, passionate and vivacious, was its centre. The others stood round, listening&mdash;Henry Wimbush, calm and polite beneath his grey bowler; Mary, with parted lips and eyes that shone with the indignation of a convinced birth-controller. Anne looked on through half-shut eyes, smiling; and beside her stood Mr. Scogan, bolt upright in an attitude of metallic rigidity that contrasted strangely with that fluid grace of hers which even in stillness suggested a soft movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gombauld ceased talking, and Mary, flushed and outraged, opened her mouth to refute him.

In the course of the next few centuries, who knows? the world may see a more complete severance. I look forward to it optimistically.

An impersonal generation will take the place of Nature&#39;s hideous system. In vast state incubators, rows upon rows of gravid bottles will supply the world with the population it requires.

They embrace the sensations&nbsp;and the emotions.&nbsp;When the skin is pricked, when light&nbsp;falls upon the eye, or when a&nbsp;piece of sugar is sucked, so many&nbsp;sensations are felt; when a person flies into a rage or is stricken&nbsp;with fear, he experiences an emotion. Some&nbsp;contend that such&nbsp;elementary emotions are primitive unanalysable states of mind,&nbsp;but it is more probable that they, and indeed all the emotions,&nbsp;are compounded of sensations -&nbsp;that they are, in fact, so many&nbsp;chords of sensations. It is well known (hence, indeed, the origin&nbsp;of the term &quot;emotion&quot;) that every emotion tends to be accompanied by a commotion of the body, e. g. cardiac disturbance,&nbsp;dilatation or contraction of arteries, a&nbsp;pouring out or drying up&nbsp;of secretions, spasm or paralysis of muscles. Now these various&nbsp;bodily changes, peculiar for each emotion, are necesarily accompanied by sensations felt in the parts commoted, and there&nbsp;can be litle doubt that these sensations enter into the feeling&nbsp;which constitutes the&nbsp;emotion. I shall asume (with Lange and&nbsp;James) that they constitute the whole of the feeling, and that&nbsp;if all these sensations were struck out, as&nbsp;would happen in the&nbsp;case of total anaesthesia of the body, nothing would remain of&nbsp;the emotion. It is true that the feeling we term an emotion&nbsp;may seem to have very little sensory element in it which can be&nbsp;definitely felt in the body; and it is for this reason that emotions&nbsp;are sometimes spoken of as feelings of the mind, in contradistinction to the sensations which are definitely felt in the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus we speak of grief as being a mental pain, and of joy as a&nbsp;mental pleasure, in contradistinction to such a pain as that&nbsp;caused by indigestion, or such a pleasure as the relish of food,&nbsp;which are said to be physical or bodily. Nevertheless it is&nbsp;probable that all emotions, whether simple, as in the case of&nbsp;anger and grief, or complex, as in the emotion of love and the&nbsp;aesthetic emotions, are made up of simple bodily sensations&nbsp;more particularly of the sensations pertaining to the parts of the&nbsp;body emotionally agitated.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>Which of the following statements is not supported by the text?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The text does not refer to &quot;thoughts&quot;&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">(for example, ideas),&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">other&nbsp;than feelings, and thus it is not supported that all thoughts are rooted in biology.

Even in times of peace, most men live lives of monotonous labor, most women are condemned to a drudgery which almost kills the possibility of happiness before youth is past, most children are allowed to grow up in ignorance of all that would enlarge their thoughts or stimulate their imagination. The few who are more fortunate are rendered illiberal by their unjust privileges, and oppressive through fear of the awakening indignation of the masses. From the highest to the lowest, almost all men are absorbed in the economic struggle: the struggle to acquire what is their due or to retain what is not their due. Material possessions, in fact or in desire, dominate our outlook, usually to the exclusion of all generous and creative impulses. Possessiveness&mdash;the passion to have and to hold&mdash;is the ultimate source of war, and the foundation of all the ills from which the political world is suffering. Only by diminishing the strength of this passion and its hold upon our daily lives can new institutions bring permanent benefit to mankind.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-indent: 4%; \">Institutions which will diminish the sway of greed are possible, but only through a complete reconstruction of our whole economic system. Capitalism and the wage system must be abolished; they are twin monsters which are eating up the life of the world. In place of them we need a system which will hold in check men&#39;s predatory impulses, and will diminish the economic injustice that allows some to be rich in idleness while others are poor in spite of unremitting labor; but above all we need a system which will destroy the tyranny of the employer, by making men at the same time secure against destitution and able to find scope for individual initiative in the control of the industry by which they live. A better system can do all these things, and can be established by the democracy whenever it grows weary of enduring evils which there is no reason to endure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-indent: 4%; \">We may distinguish four purposes at which an economic system may aim: first, it may aim at the greatest possible production of goods and at facilitating technical progress; second, it may aim at securing distributive justice; third, it may aim at giving security against destitution; and, fourth, it may aim at liberating creative impulses and diminishing possessive impulses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-indent: 4%; \">Of these four purposes the last is the most important. Security is chiefly important as a means to it. State socialism, though it might give material security and more justice than we have at present, would probably fail to liberate creative impulses or produce a progressive society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-indent: 4%; \">Our present system fails in all four purposes. It is chiefly defended on the ground that it achieves the first of the four purposes, namely, the greatest possible production of material goods, but it only does this in a very short-sighted way, by methods which are wasteful in the long run both of human material and of natural resources.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>What is the &quot;evil tree&quot; that Russell makes reference to in the opening line?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">At the end of that same paragraph, the author writes:&nbsp;<em>&quot;<span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px; text-indent: 4%;\">Possessiveness&mdash;the passion to have and to hold&mdash;is the ultimate source of war, and the foundation of all the ills from which the political world is suffering.&quot;&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px; text-indent: 4%;\">Possessiveness&nbsp;is thus the source (the &#39;tree&#39;) of war.</span></span></p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Pugnaciousness</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Posessiveness</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>The hunger for power</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Inequality</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>Which of the following would the author most recommend?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The author views possessiveness as the principle cause of suffering.

But a new study finds that depending on the nature of your envy &mdash; benign or malicious, that is &mdash; you&rsquo;ll pay a premium to either imitate the Joneses or do them one better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers from Tilburg University in The Netherlands studied envy-triggered behavior by asking students what they would do in certain social contexts. So, for instance, the authors asked students to imagine that a peer had an iPhone (or an internship, or some other desirable thing) that they coveted. The participants were then asked to imagine feeling envious and admiring of the fellow student (benign), envious and begrudging (malicious), or simply covetous of the product itself. (More on Time.com: How Not to Feel Lonely in a Crowd)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study results, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, showed a complex pattern of decisionmaking. Participants who felt benign envy said they were willing to pay about $110 more to have an iPhone, after coveting their friend&rsquo;s device. But people who maliciously coveted the iPhone were more likely to pay a premium for a related but different gadget: the BlackBerry. The findings are explained in a statement by the journal:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Note that two types of envy exist: benign and malicious envy,&rdquo; the authors explain. &ldquo;Benign envy exists if the advantage of the other person is deserved, and motivates people to attain a coveted good or position for themselves. This more motivating type of envy makes people pay an envy premium for the products that elicited their envy.&rdquo; On the other hand, malicious envy occurs if the other person is thought to be undeserving; it evokes a desire to &ldquo;pull down&rdquo; the other person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe study reveals that our impulse to judge the deservingness of others has more to do with how we view ourselves than with anything to do with our peers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Envy is not the result of all upward comparisons to another person, but primarily from those with people that are superior in a domain that is important to oneself. Social comparisons are more likely to be made with people who are initially similar, and indeed the more similar another person is, the more intense the envy is expected to be if that person is better off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBenign envy has a certain logic to it: you wish to be urbane and wealthy, so when you see a similar striver enjoying a new status object, you believe you deserve it as well and you are willing to pay a premium to get it. Meanwhile, malicious envy employs a very different system of thought: if someone you&rsquo;ve deemed junior to you suddenly gets an object you want, you wish to prove your superiority by degrading their new possession. To do that, you&rsquo;ll pay a premium for a competitive but slightly different item. (More on Time.com: Amnesia and a Camera: Photos as Memories)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benign envy, as its name suggests, isn&rsquo;t necessarily destructive (except maybe on your bank account), but malicious envy does result in negative behavior. From the study:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maliciously envious people feel frustrated and try to level the difference with the superior others by pulling those others down. Benignly envious people also feel frustrated, but they&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">try to level the difference by moving themselves up. It is important to note here that both types of envy are not associated with a motivation to be like the other, but rather they motivate behavior to solve the inequality by increasing one&rsquo;s own (benign envy) or decreasing the other&rsquo;s relative standing (malicious envy).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the next time you find yourself jealously eyeing a friend&rsquo;s new flat-screen TV or designer handbag, stop to consider what&rsquo;s motivating those feelings.

Some use herbals in addition to therapies prescribed by physicians. Nearly half the patients in a center for endocrinology and metabolic disorders self-medicated with dietary supplements without fear of side-effects from co-morbidity or other prescribed drugs. Those with chronic conditions on herbals and dietary supplements are also unlikely to disclose use of these products, raising safety concerns. Adults use supplements to treat or cure cognitive disorders more than to prevent them, with fish oil, ginkgo biloba, and vitamins most utilized. Cancer-related anorexia and cachexia is another area where herbal medicine is used.

The common reasons were: improvement of health, maintenance of general health, bone health, and heart health and lowering of cholesterol; older adults tended to be site specific, such as benefits for the heart, bones, or joints .

The fire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully free of the trammels of precision.

In this, as in every other respect, he draws the elements of his life from his ancestors, however new the recombination may be and however greatly it may be modified by subsequent conditions. A man&#39;s destiny stands not in the future but in the past. That, rightly considered, is the most vital of all vital facts. Every child thus has a right to choose his own ancestors. Naturally he can only do this vicariously, through his parents. It is the most serious and sacred duty of the future father to choose one half of the ancestral and hereditary character of his future child; it is the most serious and sacred duty of the future mother to make a similar choice.&nbsp;In choosing each other they have between them chosen the whole ancestry of their child. They have determined the stars that will rule his fate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past that fateful determination has usually been made helplessly, ignorantly, almost unconsciously. It has either been guided by an instinct which, on the whole, has worked out fairly well, or controlled by economic interests of the results of which so much cannot be said, or left to the risks of lower than bestial chances which can produce nothing but evil. In the future we cannot but have faith&mdash;for all the hope of humanity must rest on that faith&mdash;that a new guiding impulse, reinforcing natural instinct and becoming in time an inseparable accompaniment of it, will lead civilized man on his racial course. Just as in the past the race has, on the whole, been moulded by a natural, and in part sexual, selection, that was unconscious of itself and ignorant of the ends it made towards, so in the future the race will be moulded by deliberate selection, the creative energy of Nature becoming self-conscious in the civilized brain of man. This is not a faith which has its source in a vague hope. The problems of the individual life are linked on to the fate of the racial life, and again and again we shall find as we ponder the individual questions we are here concerned with, that at all points they ultimately converge towards this same racial end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we have here, therefore, to follow out the sexual relationships of the individual as they bear on society, it will be convenient at this point to put aside the questions of ancestry and to accept the individual as, with hereditary constitution already determined, he lies in his mother&#39;s womb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the mother who is the child&#39;s supreme parent. At various points in zo&ouml;logical evolution it has seemed possible that the functions that we now know as those of maternity would be largely and even equally shared by the male parent. Nature has tried various experiments in this direction, among the fishes, for instance, and even among birds. But reasonable and excellent as these experiments were, and though they were sufficiently sound to secure their perpetuation unto this day, it remains true that it was not along these lines that Man was destined to emerge. Among all the mammal predecessors of Man, the male is an imposing and important figure in the early days of courtship, but after conception has once been secured the mother plays the chief part in the racial life. The male must be content to forage abroad and stand on guard when at home in the ante-chamber of the family. When she has once been impregnated the female animal angrily rejects the caresses she had welcomed so coquettishly before, and even in Man the place of the father at the birth of his child is not a notably dignified or comfortable one. Nature accords the male but a secondary and comparatively humble place in the home, the breeding-place of the race; he may compensate himself if he will, by seeking adventure and renown in the world outside. The mother is the child&#39;s supreme parent, and during the period from conception to birth the hygiene of the future man can only be affected by influences which work through her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>According to Freud, a person&rsquo;s physical and sexual destiny lies in the past, and not the future.

Everything was in readiness. A barrier had been placed between Dantes and his old friend. No longer could Edmond look into those wide-open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death; no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed. Faria, the beneficent and cheerful companion, with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately, no longer breathed. He seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed, and fell into melancholy and gloomy revery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alone -- he was alone again -- again condemned to silence -- again face to face with nothingness! Alone! -- never again to see the face, never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth!

Die? yes, had I died years ago; but now to die would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of destiny.

A blind man once said, when asked if he would not be glad to have his eyesight, &quot;to improve the organs I have, would be as good as to give me that which is wanting in me.&quot; This sentence sums up the whole aim of blind education. Dr. Eichholtz, a noted educator of the blind, says: &quot;Education of the blind absolutely fails in its object, in so far as it fails to develop the remaining faculties to compensate for the want of sight.&quot; &quot;Touch and sight must be developed by means which practically in all respects are dissimilar. A blind man discerns the sensation from the real presence of an object at his fingers&#39; end, only by the force or weakness of that very sensation.&quot; So, then, let us consider that, to the blind, fingers are eyes, and remember that they have ten instead of two. As I have been blind since early infancy, my own case offers an illustration in point, so I hope you will not misunderstand the predominance of the personal note in these observations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blindness does not lead to any refinement of the senses of touch, hearing or smell, but to a greater keenness in the interpretation of the information furnished by these senses. Diderot says, &quot;the help which our senses reciprocally afford to each other, hinders their improvement,&quot; and so the person in possession of all the senses regards the blind man as a marvel of intelligence and skill, just because, on losing his eyesight, his remaining senses come to the rescue, and he continues to live and move and have his being without the most precious of all physical senses. In the world of the blind child eyesight plays no part, and so the other senses are made to do double duty, and the extent to which these may be cultivated is limited only by the mentality of the child, its early training and environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think hearing is the first sense to be cultivated, both in the infant and the adult suddenly deprived of eyesight. Through its ears, the child recognizes voices, detects different footfalls, is enabled to measure distance with a fair degree of accuracy, and can form a very clear idea as to the shape and dimensions of a room. All this information is conveyed to the normal child through the eyes. Dr. Illingworth, a noted educator of the blind in England, says: &quot;Of course, there is no doubt that blindness tends to a higher and more perfect development of the sense of hearing, even in the uneducated, on the same principle&nbsp;that Nature almost always comes to the aid of her children in providing protective agencies of one kind or another, even in the very lowest organisms, and, naturally, for those who are blind, the sense of hearing is the first to fall back upon for this purpose. Thus it becomes more highly developed, because there is more frequent call upon, and exercise of, that sense.&quot; Another writer has said, &quot;but a distinction should be made between sensitiveness and an ability to use the sense, between native sensory capacity of the sense organ, and the acquired ability to use that capacity.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second sense to be developed in the blind child is that of touch, and this development begins at a very early date, supplementing the sense of hearing. Long before the child is old enough to read, its fingers have become its eyes, and each of the ten fingers carries its quota of information to the active brain, the amount and quality of this information increasing with the mental development. In addition to the fingers, the nerves of the face and those of the feet contribute their share of information. The child learns to detect differences in climatic condition by the feel of the air on its face. I have often heard very young blind children exclaim, &quot;It feels like rain! It feels like a nice day! The air feels heavy! The wind feels soft! The wind is rough today!&quot; The nerves of the feet contribute their share of helpful knowledge, calling attention to differences in the ground often unnoticed by the eye, telling whether the path is smooth or rough, grass-grown or rock-strewn. The auditory and pedal nerves are mutually helpful, the ear recording and classifying the sounds made by the feet, often guiding them aright by recalling certain peculiarities of sound&mdash;whether the ground is hollow, whether the sidewalk is of board or cement, and whether there is a depression here or a raised place there. I often wonder how deaf-blind people walk as well as they do, when they can not hear their footfalls. I find walking much more difficult when on a crowded thoroughfare, or when passing a planing mill or boiler factory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last of the trio of senses whose development compensates in large measure for the want of eyesight, is that of smell. Through this sense, the child comes very close to the heart of Nature. Of course, the ear is charmed by the song of birds, the hum of insects, the murmur of wind in the trees, or the sound of mighty waters. Through the finger-tips, he learns the shape and size of each flower and shrub and tree, traces the delicate pattern of ferns, notes wonderful rock formations, and finds the first blade of tender grass coaxed to the surface by the warmth of the Spring sunshine. But all this does not bring him the keen pleasure he experiences when he inhales the fragrance of the rose, the perfume of flowers with the dew still upon them, the smell of the freshly turned earth, the newly cut grass, or the blossom laden trees. In the case of Helen Keller, the olfactory nerves have been cultivated to a very high degree, and through this sense she is often able to recognize her friends. A little blind boy once told me that each member of his family had a distinct odor, by which he could tell things worn by them, or books they had handled. Laura Bridgeman is said to have selected the laundry of the pupils in her school by this unusual process. I frequently astonish my friends by telling them when I pass a drug store or hospital, a grocery, a confectioner&#39;s, or drygoods store,&nbsp;a paint shop, a florist&#39;s stand, or a livery stable. I do not think the blind have a keener sense of taste than any other class of people, although this claim is often made, even by the blind themselves.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The passage:</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Answer 1 is correct.

Do histories that mine the past for symptoms or traces corresponding to current medical knowledge tell us anything about medical history? Or should we write histories that respect and contextualise historical knowledge on its own terms? This approach accepts, in Andrew Cunningham&rsquo;s words, that &lsquo;you die of what your doctor says you die of&rsquo;, however outdated these contemporary pronouncements might now seem to our modern gaze.&nbsp;While practitioners of retrospective diagnosis consider the employment of modern biomedical categories as a perfectly valid way to talk about disease in the past, others have criticised the practice&rsquo;s tendency to reduce the lives of individuals to &lsquo;the mere expression of disease&rsquo;. Roger Cooter, for example, has dismissed retrospective diagnosis as &lsquo;inherently condescending&rsquo;.&nbsp;The discussion about how to approach histories of disease and illness has re-emerged with renewed vigour in recent years with the publication of a slew of disease &lsquo;biographies&rsquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 5px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; color: rgb(98, 98, 98);\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">We might usefully think of retrospective diagnosis practice as a broad spectrum, whose ends bear little similarity to each other. At one end of the scale well-funded paleopathology research groups utilise expensive scientific technology to identify pathogens in archaeological remains.&nbsp;High-profile examples of this include the 1976 examination of the mummy of Ramses II by French scientists who wished to prove that the Egyptian pharaoh died from tuberculosis.&nbsp;The question of whether or not the pathogen<em style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\">Yersinia pestis</em>&nbsp;was responsible for the ravages of the Black Death in the medieval and early-modern period almost constitutes a sub-discipline.&nbsp;Recently, Monica Green has emphasised the value of cross-disciplinary collaborations that take the biological materiality of disease seriously on both global and deep chronological scales. Combining scientific disciplines including paleopathology and genetics with professional history offers a very different kind of disease work than the &lsquo;parlour game&rsquo; that imposes various illnesses on historical figures through the interpretation of texts, artefacts, images and commentary.&nbsp;Was King George III&rsquo;s madness actually porphyria? Did Nietzsche have syphilis? These kinds of diagnoses have widely been criticised; Caroline Walker Bynum&rsquo;s discussion in&nbsp;<em style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\">Holy Feast and Holy Fast</em>&nbsp;(1987) regarding whether medieval women can be said to have had &lsquo;anorexia&rsquo; remains one of the most convincing explorations of the problems and implications of making such a diagnosis if our aim is to understand a period historically. In particular, Bynum criticised a tendency to assume that we can identify either a &lsquo;secularisation&rsquo; or &lsquo;medicalisation&rsquo; of behaviour previously regarded as religious, noting that a number of medieval paradigms existed for &lsquo;not eating&rsquo;. She also noted that the validity of a diagnosis depends on which modern definition of an illness is chosen.&nbsp;If we take examples of retrospective diagnoses as historical artefacts in themselves, however, they can be very revealing. In a recent survey of theories about Jonathan Swift&rsquo;s ailments over three centuries, for example, Marjorie Lorch notes that while the evidence regarding Swift is inadequate to determine the accuracy of any individual retrospective diagnosis of his ailments, analysing how these diagnoses have changed reveals something of how &lsquo;different signs and symptoms were given status and significance by different writers at different historical periods&rsquo;.</span></p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":100},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal;\">The approach considered by Cunningham is:</span></p>\r\n","explanation":"<p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal;\">Cunningham considers the contextualised approach (you die of what your doctor says you die of); that is, your &#39;cause&#39; of death is dependent upon medical knowledge at the time.

The product PV on both sides must stay constant, and at equilibrium the pressures on both sides of the partition must be equal. Once the box is opened, the right hand side essentially becomes the atmosphere, with gas escaping until this side is in equilibrium&nbsp; with the atmosphere (1 atm). If the right hand side is continuous with the atmosphere, then it will always have 1 atm pressure, and so the left hand side will expand until the gas in the left is also at 1 atm pressure. The initial PV product on the left is 7.5, which it must be after it expands. If PV = 7.5 and P = 1, then the new volume on the left is 7.5 L</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>5 L on the left, 5 L on the right</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>6 L on the left, 4 L on the right</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>7.5 L on the left, 2.5 L on the right</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>10 L on the left, 0 L on the right</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>When a pressure difference exists across a membrane, the force on the membrane from the side at higher pressure can be calculated as</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">F = &Delta;P.

I&#39;ve sat in this seat here for about</p>\r\n\r\n<p>two or three hours now. I can&#39;t see what&#39;s passing by. It&#39;s dark now, but when the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>train left, the sun was just beginning to set, and I could see the red and brown</p>\r\n\r\n<p>leaves and the tanning grass all along the hillside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel a little better the further the train gets from the house. The tingling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>that has been running up and down the inside of my legs is stopping, and my feet</p>\r\n\r\n<p>feel like they&#39;re really there now, and not like two cold things that don&#39;t really</p>\r\n\r\n<p>belong to the rest of my body. I&#39;m not as scared anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s a colored fellow coming through between the seats. He&#39;s snapped</p>\r\n\r\n<p>off every one of the lights over the seats. There&#39;s just a tiny red one glowing at the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>end of the coach, and I&#39;m sorry it isn&#39;t bright here anymore by my seat, because I</p>\r\n\r\n<p>start to think too much in the dark about what&#39;s back in the house. They must</p>\r\n\r\n<p>have turned the heat off too. It&#39;s cold in here. I wish I had a blanket to throw over</p>\r\n\r\n<p>my knees and something to put over this seat so the plush wouldn&#39;t scratch the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>back of my neck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it was day outside, I could see where I was. I&#39;ve never been this far from</p>\r\n\r\n<p>home in my life. We must be almost two hundred miles away now. With nothing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>to see, you have to listen to the click-click-click of the train. Sometimes I hear the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>whistle sounding far ahead. I&#39;ve heard it plenty times, but I never thought I&#39;d be</p>\r\n\r\n<p>riding with it. And I don&#39;t mind the clicking. It sounds like the rain on a tin roof at</p>\r\n\r\n<p>night when it&#39;s quiet and still and the only thing you can hear is the rain and the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>thunder. But I had a train of my own. It was a toy one I got for Christmas when I</p>\r\n\r\n<p>was three. That was when Poppa was working at the factory and we lived in the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>little white house in town that had a real roof you could sleep under when it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>rained, and not a tin one like the place on the hill had that leaked through the nail</p>\r\n\r\n<p>holes too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People came to see us that Christmas. We always had some people in the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>house, coming in blowing and rubbing their hands together and shaking out their</p>\r\n\r\n<p>coats like it was snowing outside. But there was no snow. Not that year. But they</p>\r\n\r\n<p>were nice, and brought me things. I remember the preacher gave me a book of</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bible stories. But that was most likely because my mother and father were paying</p>\r\n\r\n<p>church members then, with their names on the rolls and both of them in the Adult</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Study Class that met every Sunday at nine and Wednesday night at seven for a</p>\r\n\r\n<p>social. I was in the Pre-School Play section, but we never played like the name</p>\r\n\r\n<p>said. We had to listen to stories some old woman read to us out of a grownup</p>\r\n\r\n<p>book that we didn&#39;t understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mother was very hospitable that year I got the train. Everybody got some</p>\r\n\r\n<p>of her fruitcake that she was proud of. She said it was from an old family recipe,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>but I found out later she got the cake through a mail order from some company in</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin called the Olde English Baking Company, Limited. I found that out</p>\r\n\r\n<p>when I learned to read and saw it in the mail a few Christmases later when we</p>\r\n\r\n<p>didn&#39;t have any people over and we had to eat it ourselves. No one ever knew,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>though, that she didn&#39;t make it, except me and Mother and maybe the man at the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>post office, but he was a deaf mute and couldn&#39;t tell anybody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t remember any children my age coming around that Christmas. As a</p>\r\n\r\n<p>matter of fact, there weren&#39;t any children my age living around us at all. After</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christmas was over, I stayed in the house and played with my train. It was too</p>\r\n\r\n<p>cold outside, and about January it began to snow. Heavy snows that year,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>although everyone thought they&#39;d never come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was that spring that Mother&#39;s Aunt Mae came to live with us. She was</p>\r\n\r\n<p>heavy but not fat, and about sixty, and came from out of state somewhere where</p>\r\n\r\n<p>they had nightclubs. I asked Mother why her hair wasn&#39;t shiny and yellow like</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aunt Mae&#39;s, and she said some people were just lucky, and I felt sorry for her.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM02 Fiction","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The essential style of this passage would be described as</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>To claim the passage is inessential (an absolute necessity) is a judgment which cannot be made given the lack of context for the passage.&nbsp; Therefore Option C&nbsp;is not correct.&nbsp; The passage engages with the past, but also the present, and ideas whose scope exceeds the author.&nbsp; Therefore Option D&nbsp;is not correct.&nbsp; The style of the passage is thoughtful, so option&nbsp;A is a possibility.&nbsp; However Option&nbsp;B best describes the&nbsp;scope of the passage and is therefore the answer.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Pensive</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Discursive</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>Inessential</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Nostalgic</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>More than an object the train is used by the author as a</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The use of the train is not metaphorical&nbsp;because it only represents itself, so Option&nbsp;A&nbsp;is incorrect.&nbsp; A leitmotif is a musical term, thus Option C&nbsp;is incorrect.&nbsp; As a meta-commentary references to the train would not work as they are an essential part of the actual narrative.&nbsp; B&nbsp;is the best option as the train is a dominant theme in&nbsp;the passage.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Metaphor</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Motif</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>Leitmotif</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Meta-commentary</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>The point of view in the passage is that of</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The passage is split between contemporary observations and nostalgia. &nbsp;The memories presented in the passage are those of a child, referring to parents, gifts and discovering aspects of the world, suggesting that Options A or D are correct.

Even when world-famous, Dickens acknowledged the deep formative impact that the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>wondrous figures and events of fairy tales had had on him and his creative genius. He</p>\r\n\r\n<p>repeatedly expressed scorn for those who, motivated by an uninformed and petty rationality,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>insisted on rationalizing, bowdlerizing, or outlawing these stories, and thus robbed children of</p>\r\n\r\n<p>the important contributions fairy tales could make to their lives. Dickens understood that the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>imagery of fairy tales helps children better than anything else in their most difficult and yet</p>\r\n\r\n<p>most important and satisfying task: achieving a more mature consciousness to civilize the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>chaotic pressures of their unconscious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, as in the past, the minds of both creative and average children can be opened to an</p>\r\n\r\n<p>appreciation of all the higher things in life by fairy tales, from which they can move easily to</p>\r\n\r\n<p>enjoying the greatest works of literature and art. The poet Louis MacNeice, for example, tells</p>\r\n\r\n<p>that &ldquo;Real fairy stories always meant much to me as a person, even when I was at a public</p>\r\n\r\n<p>school where to admit this meant losing face. Contrary to what many people say even now, a</p>\r\n\r\n<p>fairy story, at least of the classical folk variety, is a much more solid affair than the average</p>\r\n\r\n<p>naturalistic novel, whose hooks go little deeper than a gossip column. From folk tales and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>sophisticated fairy tales such as Hans Andersen&rsquo;s or Norse mythology and stories like the <em>Alice</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>books and <em>Water Babies </em>I graduated, at about the age of twelve, to the <em>FaerieQueene.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Literary critics such as G. K. Chesterton and C. S. Lewis felt that fairy stories are &ldquo;spiritual</p>\r\n\r\n<p>explorations&rdquo; and hence &ldquo;the most life-like&rdquo; since they reveal &ldquo;human life as seen, or felt, or</p>\r\n\r\n<p>divined from the inside.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fairy tales, unlike any other form of literature, direct the child to discover his identity and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>calling, and they also suggest what experiences are needed to develop his character further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fairy tales intimate that a rewarding, good life is within one&rsquo;s reach despite adversity&mdash;but only</p>\r\n\r\n<p>if one does not shy away from the hazardous struggles without which one can never achieve</p>\r\n\r\n<p>true identity. These stories promise that if a child dares to engage in this fearsome and taxing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>search, benevolent powers will come to his aid, and he will succeed. The stories also warn that</p>\r\n\r\n<p>those who are too timorous and narrow-minded to risk themselves in finding themselves must</p>\r\n\r\n<p>settle down to a humdrum existence&mdash;if an even worse fate does not befall them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Past generations of children who loved and felt the importance of fairy tales were subjected to</p>\r\n\r\n<p>the scorn only of pedants, as happened to MacNeice.

It is the first time this variation has appeared in the Shire, but it will not be the last, for it becomes synonymous with Bilbo&rsquo;s &ldquo;odd&rdquo; behavior. But how could he behave otherwise? Alerted by the Wizard&rsquo;s mark &mdash; and accompanied by a touch of uilleann pipes &mdash; a throng of hungry Dwarves soon comes trundling into Bag End to blunt the knives and crack the plates. The Dwarves, however, intend to assault more than Bilbo&rsquo;s cutlery. Led by Thorin Oakenshield, the company has assembled to plot their return to the lost kingdom of Erebor. Gandalf has decreed that Bilbo is to join the Dwarves&rsquo; quest as their resident burglar &mdash; despite his complete lack of burgling experience. Bilbo protests that he is a Baggins, and thus better suited to plush chairs and musty books. But Gandalf knows that the son of Belladonna Took is tempted by the opportunity to see the world beyond his windows. Bilbo will always be a citizen of the Shire, and its theme will always define him. The pull-and-push inherent in Bilbo&rsquo;s dual natures creates a unique two-part variation of the Shire theme that stretches its pentatonic-flavored harmonies into something more expressive and thoughtful. For better or worse, Bilbo is no ordinary Hobbit. The first half of his theme wraps itself tightly in safe, warm harmonies and cozy melodic contours. However, after a subtle harmonic turn, the theme moves into a new key and exposes Bilbo&rsquo;s emerging thirst for excitement with leaping intervals and a stout, confident tone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dwarves, too, are defined by their homeland. Long ago, under the leadership of Thr&oacute;r, King Under the Mountain and grandfather to Thorin Oakenshield, Erebor was a place of great wealth and power depicted by a proud, compact figure rising in three horn-calls, but remaining stubbornly affixed to its root (A&ndash;C; A&ndash;D; A&ndash;E). Most cherished among Thr&oacute;r&rsquo;s treasures was the Arkenstone, a luminous white gem matched to a glowing choral cluster and a stately string line in B minor. Word of Thr&oacute;r&rsquo;s riches soon reached Smaug the Dragon, who attacked Erebor, ousted the Dwarves, and claimed their golden hoard as his own. Countless Dwarves were left to wander the wilderness; their once-mighty race brought low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">Thorin has taken it upon himself to right this wrong. His theme directly recalls Erebor&rsquo;s, though it moves by bitter steps, not proud leaps. As a lonely French horn melody passes above A minor and G major harmonies, Thorin&rsquo;s resolve is painted with a sense of longing and melancholy. His theme expresses grim determination and the soul of a Dwarf who cannot forgive and cannot forget. Yet nestled in the noble remorse of Thorin&rsquo;s theme there is hope: the stepwise motion that opens his theme is the same that begins the Shire theme. Perhaps there is more to the Dwarves&rsquo; new burglar than meets the eye &mdash; perhaps the quest for Erebor is not in vain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">Still, if Erebor is to be retaken, Smaug must be defeated. Shore&rsquo;s theme for Smaug heaves like the bellows of a great furnace. Low brass and&nbsp;<em>divisi&nbsp;</em>celli and basses deliberately alternate between major and minor iterations of the same pulsing chord (F major&ndash;F minor&ndash;F major&ndash; F minor). Bass drum and Tibetan gongs rumble and clatter while low harp quivers with improvised patterns. Above this, winds and strings play a line that worms through chromatic intervals with an exotic gleam (E&ndash;E&ndash;F&ndash;A ; E&ndash;F&ndash;A &ndash;A &ndash;A &ndash;C ). The Dragon still lies far to the east, however, and before the Dwarves can reach him, a long journey awaits. With their burglar Hobbit in tow, Thorin&rsquo;s company sets out from Bag End accompanied by Shore&rsquo;s bold setting of the &ldquo;Misty Mountains&rdquo; song (composed by Plan 9 and David Long) &mdash; and by a comic triple-beat clarinet figure in D minor that represents Bilbo&rsquo;s fussy inflexibility.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The fundamental message that the text exudes is:</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p><strong>Option C is correct</strong>.

Radagast the Brown lives along the southern borders of Mirkwood where he cares for the flora and fauna as if they were his own. Radagast&rsquo;s theme is a whir of perpetual motion &mdash; an oscillating flow of sawing half steps, rapid arpeggios, and swirling trills enrobed in disheveled fragments of diminished harmonies. Light percussion pecks away with accompanimental sextuplets on shakers, gourds, and woodblocks, while low strings and winds bubble upward. Above this dense collection of forest murmurs, boys chorus sings a text by Phillippa Boyens: &ldquo;Meno, edveno / O galad vos ilais / Lim, meno lim / Na fuin, tr&iacute; dhuaith &hellip; &rdquo; (&ldquo;Away! Away! / From soft leaf-light / Hurry! Hurry! / Through dark of night &hellip; &rdquo;).Radagast&rsquo;s perpetual motion serves a purpose: a Necromancer now haunts Middle-earth. Little is known of this sorcerer, but there is a disturbingly familiar ring to his themes. The Necromancer and his lair are first represented by two heavy motifs. The first is a pair of descending major thirds, and the second is a rising trellis of three ascending pitches that evades downbeats. Low winds announce these ominous figures while timpani, Japanese taiko, and the West African dunun drum thunder in the percussion section. But these wonderous figures are followed by a wailing line for two oboes and <em>cor anglais </em>that rises a strident half step, then descends through augmented intervals to form the theme of the Necromancer. The exotic tone of the Necromancer&rsquo;s theme calls to mind the early days of Middle-earth, but there is a more treacherous connection as well: the same pitches that form this theme also form the string line that perches atop Smaug&rsquo;s theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The composition style taken with the Necromancer offers</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Given that Smaug&rsquo;s theme has already appeared and his evil nature is known, the commonality of the dragon&rsquo;s theme with the Necromancer&rsquo;s forms the basis of their connection, suggesting that Option B is a posibility.

While his triple-meter D minor theme protests, Bilbo does his best to enact a rescue, but he only manages to make the situation worse.

Generally, it is believed that larger organizations are more bureaucratic. The studies claim that as the organization grows in size, there is less direct personal contact among members, and informal methods of communication and coordination become inappropriate. Instead, formal patterns of interaction, routine procedures, rules and regulations, and evaluative mechanisms of performance are developed in the organization. Furthermore, the size of an organization is related to decentralization because the larger the size, the more complex its goals and information become, hence precluding centralized decision making. In contrast to this, other studies have reported that the size of an organization is not related to the bureaucratic features of the organization. They argue that large organizations do not necessarily have to be impersonal and undemocratic, while smaller ones exhibit a more humanistic and democratic climate. They claim that organizations can use other modes of control besides rules and regulations. Another important variable that should be included in an explanation of bureaucratic inflexibility is the degree of professionalization in the organization. Human service organizations tend to rely on and employ professionals to implement their goals. Therefore, one way of reducing the number of written rules in bureaucratic organizations is to employ professionals who have internalized the relevant rules because of their formal education and training. These professionals, then, do not have to consult rules in many organizational situations. Hage and Aiken&#39;s study of health and welfare organizations provides support for this reasoning. The degree of professionalization is one indicator of &quot;complexity&quot; in their study, and it is negatively correlated with the degree of formalization</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The general belief surrounding bureaucracy is that it could best be described as</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The article states by saying that &#39;generally, larger organisations are more <span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">bureaucratic&#39;, and goes on to explain that it </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">is a natural evolution of large businesses as they grow in size.

In fact, the moment of vision, says Heidegger, simply cannot be clarified in terms of the simple &quot;now,&quot; as a simple &quot;making present,&quot; but rather temporalizes itself in terms of a future, the emerging structure of the moment that cannot be summed up in any single instant.

You&#39;re working on Roma: Imago Urbis now ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vittorio Storaro: I just finished last night. Yesterday was the last day of shooting, which started six years ago. It is the longest project I&#39;ve ever worked on. It&#39; s a portrait of ancient Rome-a mosaic of the city. They&#39;re calling it the first attempt to create &quot;a multi-media encyclopedia&quot; in the modem sense. It&#39;s made for television, it will also be in theaters, but one of the primary forms of distribution will be a combination of book-with my own production photographs-and video. In about two years there will be a second release with laserdisc, and we&#39;re also considering interactive computer programs, CD-ROM, something like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q. What attracted you to the project?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vittorio Storaro:&nbsp; Several things. ... One was the opportunity to work with the director, my good friend Luigi Bazzoni. Another was the challenge of the project itself, which was basically to discover ancient Rome through its monuments and artifacts, without any distractions or signs of modem life-in a sense, to create something that was timeless. But there was also something else. I told you a long time ago that the first part of my professional life, and the way that I was trying to come to a better understanding of myself, was based on my research and study of light and each of its of properties, such as shadow and penumbra, artificial and natural, and so on. Later on, I became more interested in qualities of light itself, the spectrum of light, in colors, &quot;the children of light,&quot; as Leonardo put it. I spent a long time researching the meaning of color, what kind of response the human body has to it, how we can visualize sentiment and emotion with color, how this all relates to the physiology and psychology of the human being. Then, after The Last Emperor, I knew that I had to take another step in trying to find balance between all these different things. In the beginning, I was mainly trying to divide, to separate light from shadow, then red from blue, one color from another. It was not always conscious, but it was what I was trying to do. Now it was time to see if I could put them together, to find more harmony. The idea came to me to go back to ancient Greek philosophy, the pre-Socratics, who determined that life consists of four basic elements: water, earth, fire, and air. I wanted to understand how I could begin to visualize life itself through these four elements. And I began to think that maybe with these 15 hours of documentary I might be able to do a kind of resume of my professional life. I thought I should divide the series into three parts. One would mainly be the journey with light. One would be the journey within light, into color. And the third would be to try to find balance between these, but mainly the idea of balance between the four elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q.&nbsp; Do you feel that you succeeded?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vittorio Storaro:&nbsp; You will see the difference. It was an important journey into myself. But I&#39;m telling you all of this because it&#39;s connected to Little Buddha. Because all along, with my sensibility, my cultural background, my own experience, I&#39;m trying to express what I really am. I am trying to describe the story of the film through the visualization, the photography, so that the viewer can feel and understand, consciously and un-consciously, what the story is about. Of course, I&#39;m always working very hard to complement the director&#39;s vision, but it is also my own story, because I&#39;m using everything within myself to do that. From my first movie [Giovinezza, Giovinezza, 1969] up to Apocalypse Now, that was the first part, when I was mainly concerned about light. From then until The Last Emperor was the second part, where I was moving into light itself and this is the third part, where I am trying to find visualization through the balance of elements.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":100},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>Storaro&rsquo;s attitude might be described best as</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p><strong>Option D is correct.&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Options B&nbsp;and C&nbsp;are not supported by the passage, which leaves&nbsp;A&nbsp;and D.&nbsp;To be self-aware is to have an understanding of what one is doing while one is doing it, or being aware of their character or identity.&nbsp;To be self-conscious is essentially to be more contrived in one&rsquo;s action or feeling of themselves.

Salter&rsquo;s treatise on asthma, first published in 1860, was particularly successful. Considered a definitive text for many decades, it appeared in an American edition in 1864 and an expanded second British edition in 1868, establishing Salter&rsquo;s international reputation as an expert in the field. Like Trousseau, who regarded asthma as a &ldquo;diathetic neurosis&rdquo; closely associated with eczema and hives,<sup>&nbsp;</sup>Salter subscribed to the nervous theory of asthma, arguing that asthmatic symptoms were caused primarily by &ldquo;a spastic contraction of the fibre-cells of organic or unstriped muscle, which minute anatomy has demonstrated to exist in the bronchial tubes&rdquo;, rather than by catarrh or bronchitis. Salter&rsquo;s approach to treatment reflected this understanding of pathogenesis. In alleviating the paroxysms, he emphasized the importance of avoiding or removing any known &ldquo;exciting cause&rdquo;, as well as advocating the use of depressants such as ipecacuanha, tobacco and antimony to suppress nervous irritation, stimulants such as strong black coffee, tea, ammonia, and hot alcohol to divert &ldquo;morbid activity&rdquo; from the lungs, and a range of sedatives, including tobacco, chloroform, stramonium and belladonna, to allay irritability.<sup>&nbsp;</sup>Many of the substances discussed by Salter had dual actions: Indian hemp or Cannabis sativa, which was also becoming popular as a panacea in Britain following its introduction from India and which was regularly recommended in the form of a tincture for asthmatics, was both a stimulant and a sedative.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Salter&rsquo;s discussion of the benefits of smoking stramonium was extensive. Although he recognized that stramonium did not always guarantee relief, partly on account of the &ldquo;special caprice of asthma&rdquo; and partly because of differences in the &ldquo;mode of preparation and drying of the drug&rdquo;, he nevertheless acknowledged that its efficacy in some cases always made it worth trying. Significantly, its action was amplified if the stramonium were not merely smoked in a pipe (leading to absorption &ldquo;by the oral surface only&rdquo;),&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">but if the saliva was swallowed and the smoke inhaled &ldquo;as much as possible into the lungs&rdquo;, which had the &ldquo;advantage of being applied to the very parts affected&rdquo;. According to Salter, stramonium was more effective as a preventative than a cure. Indeed, he advocated smoking a pipe each night before bed in order to &ldquo;keep the disease at bay&rdquo;: &ldquo;The stramonium seems to leave for some hours a state of nervous system in which the asthma is not likely to come on; and, since the attack is almost always at night, the use of stramonium at bedtime conducts and guards the patient through the critical time.&rdquo;</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">The rising popularity of smoking stramonium for asthma during the middle decades of the nineteenth century can be traced to a variety of factors. In the first instance, it is evident that support for the therapeutic use of stramonium developed in tandem with medical accounts of asthma as the product of spasmodic bronchoconstriction. Articulated fully by William Cullen in the late eighteenth century, the spasmodic theory of asthma gained support during the early nineteenth century, not only from the clinical studies of Laennec but also from the work of the German physician Franz Daniel Reisseissen and others, who demonstrated the presence of circular muscle fibres around the bronchi. An emphasis on spasmodic constriction prioritized the application of anti-spasmodics, including stramonium and tobacco. Indeed, it is likely that both theory and practice were mutually reinforcing: while the spasmodic theory stipulated the use of anti-spasmodics, the apparent efficacy of stramonium legitimated theories that explained asthma in terms of nervous spasm rather than mucous obstruction.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":100},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>In Europe, the prescription of cannabis to patients with asthma was:</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>We are only told that&nbsp;Indian cannabis was:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&quot;</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">becoming popular as a panacea in Britain following its introduction from India&nbsp;and&nbsp;which was regularly recommended in the form of a tincture for asthmatics, was both a stimulant and a sedative&quot;.

This rite of passage for many young people involves travelling to certain destinations around the country or overseas to participate in organised parties and recreational activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Each year, Schoolies brings into focus two important adolescent health issues: acute alcohol-related harm and unwanted consequences of sexual activity. In Australia and the United States, young people who attend a Schoolies-like event expect to get drunk, and these expectations are usually met. Further, the incidence of binge drinking during Schoolies has not changed over time, and there is increasing gender convergence on patterns of intoxication. Significant proportions of intoxicated young people at Schoolies require transport to hospital for further care, and hospital data are likely to underestimate the extent of this problem. Fewer expect to have sex, but these expectations, when present, are also usually met, often with casual partners. As Schoolies expands to include international destinations such as Bali and Fiji, the consequences of&nbsp;additional exposure&nbsp;to communicable diseases and pre-travel vaccinations need to be considered.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For most young Australians, the end of secondary school coincides with entering adulthood. Turning 18 years old has significant legal implications: the right to vote, enter into contracts, purchase tobacco and alcohol, and consent to one&#39;s own medical treatment without the need for a mature-minor assessment, to name a few. This emancipation from childhood, symbolised for many by Schoolies, brings a new wave of health risks. The epidemiology is stark: morbidity and mortality are higher in young adults (up to 24 years) compared with younger adolescents, in Australia and overseas. In Australia, the death rate for 20&ndash;24 year-olds is almost four times greater than that for 12&ndash;14-year-olds and 1.4 times greater than that for 15&ndash;19-year-olds. Mental health disorders, chronic conditions, and notification rates for sexually transmitted infections and bloodborne viruses are all higher for 18&ndash;24-year-olds than for 12&ndash;17-year-olds.

In patients with comorbid depression and medical conditions (eg, thyroid disorders, infections, neurological conditions), the depression is often untreated or unrecognised because of shared symptoms. The United States National Comorbidity Survey found most lifetime cases of depression were secondary to another psychiatric disorder and that 75% of people with depression had another psychiatric disorder. Anxiety and depression often coexist, so that patients with a diagnosis of depression commonly experience an anxiety disorder, such as generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder or panic disorder. Alcohol and other substance dependencies and personality disorders also frequently coexist with depression, and recent studies have begun to identify &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; bipolarity features as significant factors for treatment resistance. Complexity and comorbidity should be considered the norm. These comorbidities complicate the clinical picture, worsen the depression, and make it difficult to treat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Patients with a diagnosis of depression, and specifically DTTD, often experience a range of negative environmental or contextual factors, such as family conflict, financial distress, work stress or job loss, poor-quality interpersonal relationships and social support, poor social adjustment, and other serious life events. Adverse health behaviour such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle and smoking are also identified risks for people with major depressive disorder (MDD). A recent systematic review of 25 primary studies involving 5192 patients with chronic depression identified that negative social interaction and low levels of social integration coexist with chronic depression. There is consensus that late onset of depression, family history of DTTD, and severity or chronicity of depression are also risk factors for treatment resistance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depression in primary care appears in many guises. Two-thirds of patients with depression initially present with one or more physical symptoms, and comorbid anxiety, personality traits, addictive behaviour and bipolarity can all potentially alter the clinical presentation. Furthermore, although there are probably different types of depression, such as melancholic, hopeless or situational depression, these heterogeneous presentations are often treated as though they are the one condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">If a patient has not responded fully to the first-line treatment, it is always necessary to review the diagnosis and the treatment. Antidepressant medication and psychotherapy are both recommended as first-line treatments, either alone or in combination, for patients with mild to moderate MDD. However, these treatments are not always equally efficacious. For example, there is evidence that depression characterised by severe hopelessness responds poorly to antidepressants. Coexisting psychiatric disorders and medical illnesses require treatment in their own right if the treatment for depression is to be successful. Similarly, persisting contextual factors need to be taken into account when making a comprehensive diagnosis of the situation. Continuing stressors, or poor resources and coping skills, have a ceiling effect on the level of improvement that can be expected from pharmacotherapy alone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Patients with depression often do not take, forget to take, or cannot be bothered to take their medication. This non-adherence to antidepressants is explained partly by personality characteristics, the strength of the doctor&ndash;patient alliance, intolerable side effects, and health beliefs and stigma. Patients&rsquo; attitudes and beliefs are at least as important as side effects in predicting adherence to medication. Furthermore, the depression, anhedonia and secondary demoralisation (the &ldquo;giving up&rdquo;, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t be bothered&rdquo;, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t help&rdquo; attitude) that so often accompany depressive illness reinforce the likelihood of non-compliance. Individuals with chronic depression that is difficult to treat tend to experience significant low self-esteem, anxiety, demoralisation, hopelessness, and lack of joy and drive (anhedonia). In some people, these may be lifelong traits; in others, they may be activated by the depression. Nevertheless, people with treatment-resistant depression have more negative affect and dysfunctional cognitions than those with non-resistant depression, and people who experience repetitive and unhelpful thinking about depression tend to have prolonged depressive symptoms.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":100},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>Which of the following is not listed&nbsp;as a risk factor for difficult to treat depression</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Options A, B and C are all listed as risk factors for difficult to treat depression in either the first (B) or second (A and C) paragraphs of the passage.

Although this phenomenon is common, distressing, and costly, it is rarely studied and poorly understood. The nocebo phenomenon, in which placebos produce adverse side effects, offers some insight into nonspecific side effect reporting. We performed a focused review of the literature, which identified several factors that appear to be associated with the nocebo phenomenon and/or reporting of nonspecific side effects while taking active medication: the patient&#39;s expectations of adverse effects at the outset of treatment; a process of conditioning in which the patient learns from prior experiences to associate medication-taking with somatic symptoms; certain psychological characteristics such as anxiety, depression, and the tendency to somatize; and situational and contextual factors. Physicians and other health care personnel can attempt to ameliorate nonspecific side effects to active medications by identifying in advance those patients most at risk for developing them and by using a collaborative relationship with the patient to explain and help the patient to understand and tolerate these bothersome but nonharmful symptoms.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":100},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The term &quot;nonspecific side effects&quot;, as used in the passage, best&nbsp;refers to:&nbsp;</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Although the term &quot;nonspecific side-effects&quot; could mean all of these options in some situations, in this case the article is specifcally referring to the nocebo phenomenon, and discusses how these effects occur due to patient-specific factors such as their expectations.

He had become disillusioned with the current state of medicine believing it to be more dangerous than the illness and had given up medical practice. In his new career as a translator, he found William Cullen&#39;s Materia Medica and its description of Peruvian bark, Cinchona (the source of quinine), as a treatment of malaria. Noting that the symptoms of Cinchona poisoning were similar to those of malaria, Hahnemann recalled that Hippocrates, Celsus and Paracelsus had written about the possibility of treating diseases with substances that cause similar symptoms. He began a series of experiments ingesting and later giving to willing colleagues medicinal dose of Cinchona. In each case, symptoms resembling malaria resulted and spontaneously resolved when the dosing was stopped. This observation led Hahnemann to further experimentation and the elucidation of his Law of Similars (similia similibus curentur)&mdash;&ldquo;Let likes be cured by likes.&rdquo; The development and refinement of this theory with all of its ramifications consumed the remaining 60 years of his life. Hahnemann conducted a series of &ldquo;provings,&rdquo; which were his observations of the symptoms produced by giving a specific substance to a group of healthy people. He did this to discover the potential medicinal value of a substance and learn what symptoms might, according to the Law of Similars, be treated by that substance. He named the new science homeopathy, from the Greek &ldquo;similar suffering.&rdquo; Hahnemann cited Jenner&#39;s use of the cowpox innoculum to vaccinate against small pox as an example of this principle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Passage 2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acupuncture is embedded in naturalistic theories that are compatible with Confucianism and Taoism. Such ideas as yin yang, Qi, dampness, and wind represent East Asian conceptual frameworks that emphasize the reliability of ordinary human sensory awareness. The fundamental concepts of acupuncture revolve around the idea that a body&#39;s vital energy (Qi) flows through the blood (xue) along 12 defined channels (meridians). Illness and pain are manifestations of a body&#39;s energy imbalance. Therefore, the goal of acupuncture treatment is to restore the balance and flow of the Qi&#39;s negative and positive aspects (yin and yang). This is achieved by physical manipulation near or at the obstructed meridians. The twelve fundamental meridians correspond to the body&#39;s major functions and are divided between the yin and yang. The yin meridians include gallbladder, bowel, stomach and bladder. Although the meridians have the common names for body organs, the Western and Chinese concepts of such are only loosely associated. In the Daoist tradition, illness is caused by a number of both internal and external imbalances including: wind, cold, fire, damp, heat, dryness, joy, anger, anxiety, thought, sorrow, fear, fright, diet, excessive sexual activity, fatigue, and trauma. A practitioner makes a diagnosis of illness after extensive discussion and examination of the patient. This includes an examination of the shape, color, and coating of the tongue and the strength, rhythm, and character of the radial pulse. Once a diagnosis has been made, the specific treatment may take a number of forms including solid needle placement, moxibustion which is the practice of burning dried herbs over the acupuncture needles, acupressure or cupping. Chinese medicine is a coherent system of thought that does not require validation by the West as an intellectual construct. The way to approach Chinese concepts is to see whether they are internally logical or consistent, not to disguise them as Western concepts or dismiss them because they do not conform to Western notions.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>Considering the two passages, which of the following statements is most accurate?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Despite differing&nbsp;opinions in the medical community, the passages shown here depict both homeopathy and acupuncture as legitimate therapies, making Option A correct.

In some institutions, entrance requirements also include an essay, two reference letters, an autobiographical sketch and a personal interview, much like the Ontario medical schools. While many institutions of&nbsp; naturopathy are located in the United States, two institutions can be found in Canada: the Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine in New Westminster, BC and the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (CCNM) in North York, Ontario. However, the CCNM is the country&rsquo;s only accredited four-year training program. At this institution, the first two years are spent studying anatomy, histology, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, pharmacology, and natural therapies. The next two years focus on clinical training in diagnosis and natural treatment modalities. Tuition at the CCNM for the 2002-2003 academic year was $15,175 for first-year domestic students, only slightly less than medical school tuition for the University of Toronto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Efficacy of Treatments</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) has a website&nbsp; (http://nccam.nih.gov) which provides evidence for and against a variety of alternative remedies. Despite the increased demand for CAM, there are few high quality studies that provide evidence&nbsp; for their effectiveness. In this article, we will highlight the use of two popular herbal remedies: red clover and garlic.&nbsp; With the early termination of one of the trial arms of the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative evaluating hormone replacement therapy, many women may now be&nbsp; considering using alternatives to conventional medicine to manage menopausal symptoms. One&nbsp; of the alternatives prescribed by naturopaths may include red clover (Trifolium pratense) which&nbsp; has been shown to contain plant estrogens or phytoestrogens. The class of phytoestrogens in red&nbsp; clover are the isoflavones, which are plant sterols also found in soybeans (albeit to a lesser&nbsp; degree). Their effect is believed to be exerted by possessing structural similarities to human&nbsp; estrogens and thus, when taken in large quantities, may show estrogenic activity. A study&nbsp; conducted in the Netherlands showed that red clover may have some actual therapeutic benefit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, van de Weijer and Burentsen demonstrated that the isoflavones from red clover significantly reduced menopausal hot flush&nbsp; symptoms by 44%.10 However, the trial was rather small with only thirty participants and it&nbsp; lasted for only 12 weeks. A more comprehensive study examining the ben- efits derived from red&nbsp; clover in addition to its potential toxicity is currently being conducted by the NCCAM. Thus, for&nbsp; the time being, the prescription of red clover by naturopaths for the treatment of hot flushes may be valid. The naturopath would most likely combine the herbal prescription&nbsp; with dietary and lifestyle modification advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of garlic has gradually become more popular for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.&nbsp; Of the nearly 100 chemicals in garlic, the most important appears to be allicin, an amino acid containing sulfur, which is formed when cloves are crushed.11 In rat hepatocytes, garlic was shown to inhibit the activity of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, the primary enzyme responsible for synthesizing cholesterol. However, a report examining garlic use and its effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease concluded that &ldquo;there are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding garlic&rsquo;s effects on clinical cardiovascular outcomes such as myocardial infarction.&rdquo; Garlic preparations failed to show consistent reductions in blood pressure, had no effects on glucose or insulin sensitivity, and showed only small, positive effects on cholesterol levels. Thus, garlic pills do not appear to have the beneficial effects that many consumers believe. In addition, garlic has several side effects such as bad breath, heartburn, and gastroesophageal reflux.&nbsp; It may reduce blood clotting so it should be taken with caution in patients who are on blood thinning agents.14 Thus, at the current time, garlic should only be used as a supplement to treatments of proven cardiac risk reduction benefit, such as regular exercise, weight control, tobacco avoidance, and a good diet.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":null},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The early section of the passage compares natural medicine and more official medical training</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Both medical training and natropathy training are shown as involving hard work and a long period of study.&nbsp; In this respect the two are seen in favorable juxtaposition.&nbsp; The key is &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Favourably</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>Unfavourably</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Is neutral</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Sees the two as incompatible</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>Red clover&rsquo;s effectiveness is due to</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>There is a specific reference to the fact that the clover has a similar chemistry to the hormone.&nbsp; Its red colour is immaterial.&nbsp; B. is too general.&nbsp; D. is not supported by the passage.&nbsp; C is the key.&nbsp;</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Its red colour</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>The fact that it is a herbal remedy</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Its ability to simulate human hormones</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>It is not effective</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>A crucial issue with the blind, placebo-controlled study on red clover&rsquo;s effectiveness is</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Specific reference is made to the relative smallness of the sample group used and how this can prejudice results.&nbsp; &ldquo;C&rdquo; is the key.&nbsp; &ldquo;A&rdquo; &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;D&rdquo; are too general as responses.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>The subject&rsquo;s responses</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>The subject&rsquo;s interpretation of their responses</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>The sample group size</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>The assessment criteria</p>\r\n","correct":false}]}]},{"stem_mcq":{"title":"Unit 2","description":"<p>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A less toxic therapy for older patients with AML would be of great benefit. Antibody-targeted chemotherapy is expected to be less toxic than conventional chemotherapy and has beendeveloped for the treatment of CD33-positive AML. The antibody-targeted chemotherapy Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Wyeth Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA, USA) consists ofa humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, a highly potent antitumor antibiotic that cleaves double-stranded DNA at specific sequences. Approximately 90% of AML patients have myeloid blast cells that express the CD33 surface antigen. This antigen is present on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells or on nonhematopoietic cells. It also is present on the leukemic stem cells of at least some AML patients.26 Thus, Mylotarg is targeted treatment for patients with CD33-positive AML because the antibody component of the molecule targets calicheamicin, the cytotoxic component, to CD33-positive cells. In a phase I dose-escalation trial with relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML patients, eight of 40 (20%) patients treated with Mylotarg had leukemic blast cells eliminated from the blood and marrow. In phase II efficacy and safety trials, a preliminary report indicated that 42 of 142 (30%) patients with AML in first relapse obtained remission after treatment with two doses of Mylotarg at 9 mg/m2. Although severe myelosuppression was common, mucositis and severe infections were not. Based on these data, Mylotarg was approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with CD33-positive AML in first relapse who are 60 years of age or older and who are not considered candidates for other cytotoxic chemotherapy. Here, we specifically report data from the phase II trials on the efficacy and safety of Mylotarg in patients&nbsp; 60 years of age for whom it was approved. These results show that Mylotarg, as a single agent, offers an effective, well-tolerated treatment option for older patients with AML in first relapse. These 101 older patients were included among the 188 adult patients of all ages who were enrolled on the phase II clinical trials.

International trade theory, in particular, conventionally treats nations as dimensionless points (and frequently assumes zero transportation costs between countries as well). Admittedly, models descended from von Th&uuml;nen play an important role in urban studies, while Hotelling-type models of locational competition get a reasonable degree of attention in industrial organization. On the whole, however, it seems fair to say that the study of economic geography plays at best a marginal role in economic theory. On the face of it, this neglect is surprising. The facts of economic geography are surely among the most striking features of real-world economies, at least to laymen. For example, one of the most remarkable things about the United States is that in a generally sparsely populated country, much of whose land is fertile, the bulk of the population resides in a few clusters of metropolitan areas; forty percent are crowded into a not especially inviting section of the East Coast. It has often been noted that nighttime satellite photos of Europe reveal little of political boundaries, but clearly suggest a center-periphery pattern whose hub is somewhere in or near Belgium. A laynian might have expected that these facts would play a key role in economic modelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, there is a long if somewhat thin tradition in location theory, that one might have supposed would inspire the efforts of both theorists and econometricians. Indeed, several schools of thought may be identified. Best known, perhaps, is the German School, originating in the work of von Th&uuml;nen (1826) but led in the twentieth century by Weber (1909), Christaller (1933), and L&ouml;sch (1940). Inspired by this German school, but less preoccupied with the geometry of location, was the American school of regional science, including Hoover (1948) and especially Isard (1956). Yet another tradition, drawing on Marshall&#39;s initial description of agglomeration due to external economies, stresses the role of externalities in producing divergent regional development; the most influential writings in this tradition are those of Myrdal (1957), Hirschmann (1958), and Perroux (1950), and this tradition has been carried on more recently by David (1984) and Arthur (1989).</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":null},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The passage opens with</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The passage begins with a broad range of facts, all of which fulfill options &ldquo;A&rdquo; &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rdquo; is the option which therefore best addresses the question.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>A critique of contemporary economics</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>A definition of Economic Geography</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>A provision of contextual information</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>All of the above</p>\r\n","correct":true}]},{"description":"<p>The observations on center-periphery in the passage relate to</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The middle of the passage makes observations about where people live in America, with most areas sparsely populated and others densely populated.&nbsp; This supports &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Population distribution</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>The distribution of economic centers</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>The areas central to a landmass</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Both a and b combined</p>\r\n","correct":false}]}]},{"stem_mcq":{"title":"Unit 4","description":"<p>EXTERMINATOR!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the war I worked for A. J. Cohen Exterminators ground floor office dead end street by the river. An old Jew with cold gray fish eyes and a cigar was the oldest of four brothers. Marv was the youngest wore wind breakers had three kids. There was a smooth well dressed college trained brother. The fourth brother burly and muscular looked like an old time hoofer could bellow a leather lunged &quot;Mammy&quot; and you hope he won&#39;t do it. Every night at closing time these two brothers would get in a heated argument from nowhere I could see the older brother would take the cigar out of his mouth and move across the floor with short sliding steps advancing on the vaudeville brother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You vant I should spit right in your face!? You vant!? You vant? You vant!?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vaudeville brother would retreat shadow boxing presences invisible to my Goyish eyes which I took to be potent Jewish Mammas conjured up by the elder brother. On many occasions I witnessed this ritual open mouthed hoping the old cigar would let fly one day but he never did. A few minutes later they would be talking quietly and checking the work slips as the exterminators fell in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand the old brother never argued with his exterminators. &quot;That&#39;s why I have a cigar&quot; he said the cigar being for him a source of magical calm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used my own car a black Ford V8 and worked alone carrying my bedbug spray pyrithium powder bellows and bulbs of fluoride up and down stairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Exterminator! You need the service?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fat smiling Chinese rationed out the pyrithium powder &mdash; it was hard to get during the war &mdash; and cautioned us to use fluoride whenever possible. Personally I prefer a pyrithium job to a fluoride. With the pyrithium you kill the roaches right there in front of God and the client whereas this starch and fluoride you leave it around and back a few days later a southern defense worker told me &quot;They eat it and run around here fat as hawgs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a great distance I see a cool remote neighborhood blue windy day in April sun cold on your exterminator there climbing the gray wooden outside stairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Exterminator lady. You need the service?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well come in young man and have a cup of tea. That wind has a bite to it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It does that, mam, cuts me like a knife and I&#39;m not well you know/cough/.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You put me in mind of my brother Michael Fenny.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He passed away?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was a long time ago April day like this sun cold on a thin boy with freckles through that door like yourself. I made him a cup of hot tea. When I brought it to him he was gone.&quot; She gestured to the empty blue sky &quot;cold tea sitting right where you are sitting now.&quot; I decide this old witch deserves a pyrithium job no matter what the fat Chinese allows. I lean forward discreetly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is it roaches Mrs. Murphy?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is that from those Jews downstairs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Or is it the Hunkys next door Mrs. Murphy?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She shrugs &quot;Sure and an Irish cockroach is as bad as another.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You make a nice cup of tea Mrs. Murphy . . . Sure I&#39;ll be taking care of your roaches . . . Oh don&#39;t be telling me where they are . . . You see I know Mrs. Murphy . . . experienced along these lines . . . And I don&#39;t mind telling you Mrs. Murphy I like my work and take pride in it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well the city exterminating people were around and left some white powder draws roaches the way whisky will draw a priest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They are a cheap outfit Mrs. Murphy. What they left was fluoride. The roaches build up a tolerance and become addicted. They can be dangerous if the fluoride is suddenly withdrawn . . . Ah just here it is . . .&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have spotted a brown crack by the kitchen sink put my bellows in and blow a load of the precious yellow powder. As if they had heard the last trumpet the roaches stream out and flop in convulsions on the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well I never!&quot; says Mrs. Murphy and turns me back as I advance for the coup de grace . . . &quot;Don&#39;t shoot them again. Just let them die.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it is all over she sweeps up a dust pan full of roaches into the wood stove and makes me another cup of tea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to bedbugs there is a board of health regulation against spraying beds and that of course is just where the bugs are in most cases now an old wood house with bedbugs back in the wood for generations only thing is to fumigate . . . So here is Mamma with a glass of sweet wine her beds back and ready . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I look at her over the syrupy red wine . . . &quot;Lady we don&#39;t spray no beds. Board of health regulations you know.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ach so the wine is not enough?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She comes back with a crumpled dollar. So I go to work . . . bedbugs great red clusters of them in the ticking of the mattresses. I mix a little formaldehyde with my kerosene in the spray its more sanitary that way and if you tangle with some pimp in one of the Negro whore houses we service a face full of formaldehyde keeps the boys in line. Now you&#39;ll often find these old Jewish grandmas in a back room like their bugs and we have to force the door with the younger generation smooth college trained Jew there could turn into a narcotics agent while you wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All right grandma, open up!

The first time he saw Carl, Lee thought, &quot;I could use that, if the family jewels weren&#39;t in pawn to Uncle Junk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boy was blond, his face thin and sharp with a few freckles, always a little pink around the ears and nose as though he had just washed. Lee had never known anyone to look as clean as Carl. With his small round brown eyes and fuzzy blond hair, he reminded Lee of a young bird.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born in Munich, Carl had grown up in Baltimore. In manner and outlook he seemed European. He shook hands with traces of a heel-click. In general, Lee found European youths easier to talk to than Americans. The rudeness of many Americans depressed him, a rudeness based on a solid ignorance of the whole concept of manners, and on the proposition that for social purposes, all people are more or less equal and interchangeable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Lee looked for in any relationship was the feel of contact. He felt some contact with Carl. The boy listened politely and seemed to understand what Lee was saying. After some initial balking, he accepted the fact of Lee&#39;s sexual interest in his person. He told Lee, &quot;Since I can&#39;t change my mind about you, I will have to change my mind about other things.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Lee soon found out he could make no progress. &quot;If I got this far with an American kid,&quot; he reasoned, &quot;I could get the rest of the way. So he&#39;s not queer. People can be obliging. What is the obstacle?&quot; Lee finally guessed the answer: &quot;What makes it impossible is that his mother wouldn&#39;t like it.&quot; And Lee knew it was time to pack in. He recalled a homosexual Jewish friend who lived in Oklahoma City. Lee had asked, &quot;Why do you live here? You have enough money to live anywhere you like.&quot; The reply was, &quot;It would kill my mother if I moved away.&quot; Lee had been speechless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One afternoon Lee was walking with Carl by the Amsterdam Avenue park. Suddenly Carl bowed slightly and shook Lee&#39;s hand. &quot;Best of luck,&quot; he said, and ran for a streetcar. Lee stood looking after him, then walked over into the park and sat down on a concrete bench that was molded to resemble wood. Blue flowers from a blossoming tree had fallen on the bench and on the walk in front of it. Lee sat there watching the flowers move along the path in a warm spring wind. The sky was clouding up for an afternoon shower. Lee felt lonely and defeated. &quot;I&#39;ll have to look for someone else,&quot; he thought. He covered his face with his hands. He was very tired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He saw a shadowy line of boys. As each boy came to the front of the line, he said &quot;Best of luck,&quot; and ran for a streetcar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sorry . . . wrong number ... try again . . . somewhere else . . . someplace else . . . not here. . . not</p>\r\n\r\n<p>me ... can&#39;t use it, don&#39;t need it, don&#39;t want it.

Two Mexican adolescents walked by, their arms around each other&#39;s necks. He looked after them, licking his dry, cracked lips. Lee continued to see Carl after that, until finally Carl said &quot;Best of luck&quot; for the last time, and walked away.

If I work on a case two days and spend two hundred dollars, I refund six hundred to the client. If I have to leave the country, the retainer is two thousand. Are these terms satisfactory?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Very good. I&#39;ll start right here in New York. Sometimes I have been able to provide the client with the missing person&#39;s address after a few hours&#39; work. He may have written to a friend.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That&#39;s easy. He left his address book.

I want to know preferences in food, clothing, colors, reading, entertainment, use of drugs and alcohol, what cigarette brand he smokes, medical history. I have a questionnaire printed with five pages of questions. I got it out of the filing cabinet and passed it to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Will you please fill out this questionnaire and bring it back here day after tomorrow.

But friends of an M.P. &mdash;missing person&mdash;are not always honest with the family. Besides, I daresay some of them have moved or had their phones disconnected. Right?&quot; He nodded. I put my hands on the questionnaire. &quot;Some of these questions may seem irrelevant but they all add up. I found a missing person once from knowing that he could wriggle his ears. I&#39;ve noticed that you are left-handed.

If I use any I&#39;ll have copies made and return the originals. If he did any painting, sketching, or writing I&#39;d like to see that too. If he sang or played an instrument, I want recordings. In fact, any recordings of his voice. And please bring if possible some article of clothing that hasn&#39;t been dry-cleaned since he wore it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It&#39;s true then that you use uh psychic methods?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I use any methods that help me to find the missing person.

That&#39;s why I came to you. She has an intuition that something has happened to him and she says only a psychic can find him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That makes two of us, I thought.

Bloom, left alone, is aware of &quot;the incipient intimations of proximate dawn&quot; (17.1247-48 [704:30]). Sunrise in Dublin on 17 June 1904 was at 3:33 A,M., so, depending on the cloud cover, daylight would have begun to gray things as early as 2:00A.M. Would it help to move Circe, Eumaeus, and Ithaca back an hour, as the Linati schema does, relocating Ithaca at 1:00 A.M.? That would ease the timetable from the beginning of Ithaca to first light to sunrise and almost make it believable that Molly hears the chimes of &quot;George&#39;s church&quot; ring &quot;2 o&rsquo;clock&quot; (18.1231-32[772:27-28]), but it would incredibly clog the hours from 11 :00 P.M. to 1 :00 A.M.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If elaborate efforts to establish accurate timetables tend to fairer, they also tend to mislead our attention as readers and distract us from the variety of ways Joyce imitates time. We are all aware, for example, that we can think and perceive far more in the course of a few minutes of multi-leveled consciousness than we could spell out in words in as many hours. Joyce variously explores that disparity. At 8.481 (164:23) Bloom reflects that it is &quot;five minutes&quot; since he fed the birds from O&#39;Connell Bridge, and it <em>is </em>a five minute stroll from the bridge to the front of Trinity College where Bloom is, but he feeds the birds at 8.75-76 (153:7-8), a good&nbsp;&nbsp; twenty minute read away. Twenty minutes of prose time is being manipulated to imitate five minutes of half-formed thought-perception time, thought-perception that could be verbalized&nbsp; but usually is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are even more radical experiments with the disparities between clock time, psychological time, and the imitation of time in the Circe and Penelope episodes. Because the Circe episode is cast in the form of a play with speeches and stage directions, we assume that reading time is approximately equal to playing time. But the reverse is the case: there is a radical disparity between reading time and playing time. For example, the hallucination at <em>Introduction 3 </em>15.1354-1956 (pp. 478-99), which we associate with Bloom, actually takes place between the two halves of Zoe&#39;s speech: &quot;Go on. Make a stump speech out of it. . . . Talk away till you&#39;re black in the face,&quot; And again at 15.2750 (527: 10), Bella Cohen, the whore mistress, enters with the line, &quot;My word! I&#39;m all of a muck sweat,&quot; and continues at 15.3500 (555:2-3), &quot;Which of you was playing the dead march from <em>Saul?&quot; </em>The implication is that the hallucinations we associate with Bloom are acted out not for his witness but for ours; what are mere blips on the screen of his consciousness are dramatized and spelled out for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Psychoanalysts I have consulted about Bloom&#39;s hallucinations say that the ones we associate with him would unfold not in the course of one night&#39;s dreams, but over a period of about two years for the average patient undergoing analysis. In other words, the hallucinations last only a moment in dramatic time but are spelled out in a dramatic imitation of epic time, the two years or so of this phase-in-the-life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Penelope episode the prose seems to imitate the way Molly might mutter to herself. Read aloud, the duration of the episode is three hours. Is that the order of time Joyce is imitating? Or is the muttering voice of the prose in turn imitating the foreshortened time and kaleidoscopic scatter of image we experience in brief spells of insomnia, an hour or less by the clock? I suspect that the Penelope episode&#39;s time is <em>more </em>like the time of hallucination and drama in Circe than it is like the time of a voice overheard and, therefore, that Molly&#39;s soliloquy belongs at <em>once </em>in the dramatic and the epic dimensions of time.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":null},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>A crucial assumption which the passage makes is that</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Option &ldquo;D&rdquo; obviously is possible, so would not qualify as an assumption.&nbsp; &ldquo;C&rdquo; also is obvious and wouldn&rsquo;t qualify as an assumption.&nbsp; This leaves &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;.&nbsp; Of the two &ldquo;B&rdquo; is referenced specifically in the passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;B&rdquo; is the key.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Everyone reads at the same speed</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Everyone would read the same amount in 20 minutes</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>There is some kind of equivalence between reading time and thinking time</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Thoughts can be represented in writing</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>The passage suggest a possible intersection between</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Literature deals with the depiction of things.&nbsp; This would indicate &ldquo;C&rdquo; or &ldquo;D&rdquo;.&nbsp; A hallucination would qualify more as fantasy than memory.&nbsp; This indicates &ldquo;D&rdquo; as the answer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Private fantasy and private memory</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Private memory and collective memory</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>The depiction of private memory and collective memory</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>The depiction of private fantasy and private memory</p>\r\n","correct":true}]},{"description":"<p>Disciplines tied together in this passage include</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Options &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;D&rdquo; are essentially the same answer.&nbsp; This rules them out.&nbsp; The mechanics of the brain are discussed in some detail.&nbsp; This would favour &ldquo;A&rdquo; over &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Neurology and literature</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>Neurology, psychology and literature</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Literature and psychology</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>All of the above</p>\r\n","correct":false}]}]},{"stem_mcq":{"title":"Unit 12","description":"<p>Explaining to a child why a fairy tale is so captivating to him destroys, moreover, the story&rsquo;s enchantment, which depends to a considerable degree on the child&rsquo;s not quite knowing why he is delighted by it. And with the forfeiture of this power to enchant goes also a loss of the story&rsquo;s potential for helping the child struggle on his own, and master all by himself the problem which has made the story meaningful to him in the first place. Adult interpretations, as correct as they may be, rob the child of the opportunity to feel that he, on his own, through repeated hearing and ruminating about the story, has coped successfully with a difficult situation. We grow, we find meaning in life, and security in ourselves by having understood and solved personal problems on our own, not by having them explained to us by others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fairy-tale motifs are not neurotic symptoms, something one is better off understanding rationally so that one can rid oneself of them. Such motifs are experienced as wondrous because the child feels understood and appreciated deep down in his feelings, hopes, and anxieties, without these all having to be dragged up and investigated in the harsh light of a rationality that is still beyond him. Fairy tales enrich the child&rsquo;s life and give it an enchanted quality just because he does not quite know how the stories have worked their wonder on him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book has been written to help adults, and most especially those with children in their care, to become more fully aware of the importance of such tales. As has already been pointed out, innumerable interpretations besides those suggested in the text that follows may be pertinent; fairy tales, like all true works of art, possess a multifarious richness and depth that far transcend what even the most thorough discursive examination can extract from them. What is said in this book should be viewed as illustrative and suggestive merely. If the reader is stimulated to go beyond the surface in his own way, he will extract ever more varied personal meaning from these stories, which will then also become more meaningful to the children he may tell them to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, however, one especially crucial limitation must be noted: The true meaning and impact of a fairy tale can be appreciated, its enchantment can be experienced, only from the story in its original form. Describing the significant features of a fairy tale gives as little feeling for what it&nbsp; is all about as the listing of the events of a poem does for its appreciation. Such a description of main features, however, is all that a book like this one can provide, short of actually reprinting the stories. Since most of these fairy tales are readily available elsewhere, the hope is that this book will be read in conjunction with a re-reading of the tales discussed.* Whether it is &ldquo;Little Red Riding Hood,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cinderella,&rdquo; or any other fairy tale, only the story itself permits an appreciation of its poetic qualities, and with it an understanding of how it enriches a responsive mind.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":null},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The author takes what specific attitude in his writing?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The author clearly establishes the need to explain what motivates fairy tales.&nbsp; As such his intention is not condescending or paternalistic.&nbsp; The author is authoritative by default, but mainly interested in educating.&nbsp; &ldquo;C&rdquo; is the key.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Condescending</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Paternalistic</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Instructive</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>Authoritative</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>A paradox the passage presents is that</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The passage explicitly states that its own interpretations of dreams are not definitive and hence can only be given as much credence as the reader might wish to grant them.&nbsp; This fundamentally undermines the writers authority.&nbsp; &ldquo;B&rdquo; is the key.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>It discusses fairy tales while being aimed at an adult audience</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>It disavows its own authority as a text</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>It explores childhood issues</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>It analyses the importance of not engaging in analysis</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>The function of this text as a(n)</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>No one needs instructions on how to read fairy tales.&nbsp; This precludes &ldquo;C&rdquo;.&nbsp; The structure of the book is not as an annotation.&nbsp; This precludes &ldquo;A&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;B&rdquo; is too vague.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rdquo; is the key.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Annotated companion to fairy tales</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Guide to fairy tales</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>How-to manual on reading fairy tales</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Scholarly supplement to fairy tales</p>\r\n","correct":true}]}]},{"stem_mcq":{"title":"Unit 13","description":"<p>EXT.

He had walked very quickly uphill through ferns and hawthorn bushes, startling deer and wild birds, to a place crowned by a single oak tree. It was very high, so high indeed that nineteen English counties could be seen beneath; and on clear days thirty or perhaps forty, if the weather was very fine. Sometimes one could see the English Channel, wave reiterating upon wave. Rivers could be seen and pleasure boats gliding on them; and galleons setting out to sea; and armadas with puffs of smoke from which came the dull thud of cannon firing; and forts on the coast; and castles among the meadows; and here a watch tower; and there a fortress; and again some vast mansion like that of Orlando&#39;s father, massed like a town in the valley circled by walls. To the east there were the spires of London and the smoke of the city; and perhaps on the very sky line, when the wind was in the right quarter, the craggy top and serrated edges of Snowdon herself showed mountainous among the clouds. For a moment Orlando stood counting, gazing, recognizing. That was his father&#39;s house; that his uncle&#39;s. His aunt owned those three great turrets among the trees there. The heath was theirs and the forest; the pheasant and the deer, the fox, the badger, and the butterfly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He sighed profoundly, and flung himself--there was a passion in his movements which deserves the word--on the earth at the foot of the oak tree.

To the oak tree he tied it and as he lay there, gradually the flutter in and about him stilled itself; the little leaves hung, the deer stopped; the pale summer clouds stayed; his limbs grew heavy on the ground; and he lay so still that by degrees the deer stepped nearer and the rooks wheeled round him and the swallows dipped and circled and the dragonflies shot past, as if all the fertility and amorous activity of a summer&#39;s evening were woven web-like about his body.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM02 Fiction","published":true,"difficulty":null},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>In the passage the main character</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The author says he &lsquo;opens his lips for the first time in this record&rsquo;, i.e. speaks for the first time in the novel.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>speaks for the first time in the novel</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>first has his voice recorded</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>speaks for the first time</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>is born</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>The author uses</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The author says 19 counties can be seen from the hill, plus galleons, armadas, forts and castles.

The recognition that love represents the highest morality was nowhere denied or contradicted, but this truth was so interwoven everywhere with all kinds of falsehoods which distorted it, that finally nothing of it remained but words. It was taught that this highest morality was only applicable to private life&mdash;for home use, as it were&mdash;but that in public life all forms of violence&mdash;such as imprisonment, executions, and wars&mdash;might be used for the protection of the majority against a minority of evildoers, though such means were diametrically opposed to any vestige of love. And though common sense indicated that if some men claim to decide who is to be subjected to violence of all kinds for the benefit of others, these men to whom violence is applied may, in turn, arrive at a similar conclusion with regard to those who have employed violence to them, and though the great religious teachers of Brahmanism, Buddhism, and above all of Christianity, foreseeing such a perversion of the law of love, have constantly drawn attention to the one invariable condition of love (namely, the enduring of injuries, insults, and violence of all kinds without resisting evil by evil) people continued&mdash;regardless of all that leads man forward&mdash;to try to unite the incompatibles: the virtue of love, and what is opposed to love, namely, the restraining of evil by violence.

In some institutions, entrance requirements also include an essay, two reference letters, an autobiographical sketch and a personal interview, much like the Ontario medical schools. While many institutions of&nbsp;naturopathy are located in the United States, two institutions can be found in Canada: the Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine in New Westminster, BC and the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (CCNM) in North York, Ontario. However, the CCNM is the country&rsquo;s only accredited four-year training program. At this institution, the first two years are spent studying anatomy, histology, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, pharmacology, and natural therapies. The next two years focus on clinical training in diagnosis and natural treatment modalities.

One&nbsp;of the alternatives prescribed by naturopaths may include red clover (Trifolium pratense) which&nbsp;has been shown to contain plant estrogens or phytoestrogens. The class of phytoestrogens in red&nbsp;clover are the isoflavones, which are plant sterols also found in soybeans (albeit to a lesser&nbsp; degree). Their effect is believed to be exerted by possessing structural similarities to human&nbsp;estrogens and thus, when taken in large quantities, may show estrogenic activity. A study&nbsp;conducted in the Netherlands showed that red clover may have some actual therapeutic benefit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, van de Weijer and Burentsen demonstrated that the isoflavones from red clover significantly reduced menopausal hot flush&nbsp;symptoms by 44%.<span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">However, the trial was rather small with only thirty participants and it</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">&nbsp;lasted for only 12 weeks</span>. A more comprehensive study examining the benefits derived from red&nbsp;clover in addition to its potential toxicity is currently being conducted by the NCCAM. Thus, for&nbsp;the time being, the prescription of red clover by naturopaths for the treatment of hot flushes may be valid. The naturopath would most likely combine the herbal prescription&nbsp;with dietary and lifestyle modification advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of garlic has gradually become more popular for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.&nbsp; Of the nearly 100 chemicals in garlic, the most important appears to be allicin, an amino acid containing sulfur, which is formed when cloves are crushed.&nbsp;In rat hepatocytes, garlic was shown to inhibit the activity of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, the primary enzyme responsible for synthesizing cholesterol. However, a report examining garlic use and its effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease concluded that &ldquo;there are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding garlic&rsquo;s effects on clinical cardiovascular outcomes such as myocardial infarction.&rdquo; Garlic preparations failed to show consistent reductions in blood pressure, had no effects on glucose or insulin sensitivity, and showed only small, positive effects on cholesterol levels. Thus, garlic pills do not appear to have the beneficial effects that many consumers believe. In addition, garlic has several side effects such as bad breath, heartburn, and gastroesophageal reflux.&nbsp;It may reduce blood clotting so it should be taken with caution in patients who are on blood thinning agents.&nbsp;Thus, at the current time, garlic should only be used as a supplement to treatments of proven cardiac risk reduction benefit, such as regular exercise, weight control, tobacco avoidance, and a good diet.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":1},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The early section of the passage, the author:</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p><strong>Option A is correct</strong>; the author spends the first paragraph demonstrating how many of the important characteristics of a medicine degree are also required to attain a natural medicine degree.&nbsp;Both medical training and natropathy training are shown as involving hard work and a long period of study.&nbsp;The long period of study for conventional medicine is similarly is required for natural medicine.

Antibody-targeted chemotherapy is expected to be less toxic than conventional chemotherapy and has been developed for the treatment of CD33-positive AML. The antibody-targeted chemotherapy Mylotarg&nbsp;consists of a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, a highly potent antitumor antibiotic that cleaves double-stranded DNA at specific sequences. Approximately 90% of AML patients have myeloid blast cells that express the CD33 surface antigen. This antigen is present on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells or on nonhematopoietic cells. It also is present on the leukemic stem cells of at least some AML patients.&nbsp;Thus, Mylotarg is targeted treatment for patients with CD33-positive AML because the antibody component of the molecule targets calicheamicin, the cytotoxic component, to CD33-positive cells. In a phase I dose-escalation trial with relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML patients, eight of 40 (20%) patients treated with Mylotarg had leukemic blast cells eliminated from the blood and marrow. In phase II efficacy and safety trials, a preliminary report indicated that 42 of 142 (30%) patients with AML in first relapse obtained remission after treatment with two doses of Mylotarg at 9 mg/m2. Although severe myelosuppression was common, mucositis and severe infections were not. Based on these data, <span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">Mylotarg</span>&nbsp;was approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with CD33-positive AML in first relapse who are 60 years of age or older and who are not considered candidates for other cytotoxic chemotherapy. Here, we specifically report data from the phase II trials on the efficacy and safety of Mylotarg in patients&nbsp;60 years of age for whom it was approved. These results show that Mylotarg, as a single agent, offers an effective, well-tolerated treatment option for older patients with AML in first relapse. These 101 older patients were included among the 188 adult patients of all ages who were enrolled on the phase II clinical trials.

International trade theory, in particular, conventionally treats nations as dimensionless points (and frequently assumes zero transportation costs between countries as well). Admittedly, models descended from <span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">von Th&uuml;nen play an important role in urban studies, while Hotelling-type</span>&nbsp;models of locational competition get a reasonable degree of attention in industrial organization. On the whole, however, it seems fair to say that the study of economic geography plays at best a marginal role in economic theory. On the face of it, this neglect is surprising. The facts of economic geography are surely among the most striking features of real-world economies, at least to laymen. For example, one of the most remarkable things about the United States is that in a generally sparsely populated country, much of whose land is fertile, the bulk of the population resides in a few clusters of metropolitan areas; forty percent are crowded into a not especially inviting section of the East Coast. It has often been noted that nighttime satellite photos of Europe reveal little of political boundaries, but clearly suggest a center-periphery pattern whose hub is somewhere in or near Belgium. A laynian might have expected that these facts would play a key role in economic modelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, there is a long if somewhat thin tradition in location theory, that one might have supposed would inspire the efforts of both theorists and econometricians. Indeed, several schools of thought may be identified. Best known, perhaps, is the German School, originating in the work of von Th&uuml;nen (1826) but led in the twentieth century by Weber (1909), Christaller (1933), and L&ouml;sch (1940). Inspired by this German school, but less preoccupied with the geometry of location, was the American school of regional science, including Hoover (1948) and especially Isard (1956). Yet another tradition, drawing on Marshall&#39;s initial description of agglomeration due to external economies, stresses the role of externalities in producing divergent regional development; the most influential writings in this tradition are those of Myrdal (1957), Hirschmann (1958), and Perroux (1950), and this tradition has been carried on more recently by David (1984) and Arthur (1989).</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The passage opens with</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>A is true as the passage discusses how contemporary economics fails to properly include economic geography, which the article suggests is an important factor.&nbsp;B is provided by the definition of economic geography as &#39;<span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">of the location of factors of production in space&#39;</span>.

The first time he saw Carl, Lee thought, &quot;I could use that, if the family jewels weren&#39;t in pawn to Uncle Junk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boy was blond, his face thin and sharp with a few freckles, always a little pink around the ears and nose as though he had just washed. Lee had never known anyone to look as clean as Carl. With his small round brown eyes and fuzzy blond hair, he reminded Lee of a young bird.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born in Munich, Carl had grown up in Baltimore. In manner and outlook he seemed European. He shook hands with traces of a heel-click. In general, Lee found European youths easier to talk to than Americans. The rudeness of many Americans depressed him, a rudeness based on a solid ignorance of the whole concept of manners, and on the proposition that for social purposes, all people are more or less equal and interchangeable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Lee looked for in any relationship was the feel of contact. He felt some contact with Carl. The boy listened politely and seemed to understand what Lee was saying. After some initial balking, he accepted the fact of Lee&#39;s sexual interest in his person. He told Lee, &quot;Since I can&#39;t change my mind about you, I will have to change my mind about other things.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Lee soon found out he could make no progress. &quot;If I got this far with an American kid,&quot; he reasoned, &quot;I could get the rest of the way. So he&#39;s not queer. People can be obliging. What is the obstacle?&quot; Lee finally guessed the answer: &quot;What makes it impossible is that his mother wouldn&#39;t like it.&quot; And Lee knew it was time to pack in. He recalled a homosexual Jewish friend who lived in Oklahoma City. Lee had asked, &quot;Why do you live here? You have enough money to live anywhere you like.&quot; The reply was, &quot;It would kill my mother if I moved away.&quot; Lee had been speechless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One afternoon Lee was walking with Carl by the Amsterdam Avenue park. Suddenly Carl bowed slightly and shook Lee&#39;s hand. &quot;Best of luck,&quot; he said, and ran for a streetcar. Lee stood looking after him, then walked over into the park and sat down on a concrete bench that was molded to resemble wood. Blue flowers from a blossoming tree had fallen on the bench and on the walk in front of it. Lee sat there watching the flowers move along the path in a warm spring wind. The sky was clouding up for an afternoon shower. Lee felt lonely and defeated. &quot;I&#39;ll have to look for someone else,&quot; he thought. He covered his face with his hands. He was very tired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He saw a shadowy line of boys.

Two Mexican adolescents walked by, their arms around each other&#39;s necks. He looked after them, licking his dry, cracked lips.

Bloom, left alone, is aware of &quot;the incipient intimations of proximate dawn&quot; (17.1247-48 [704:30]). Sunrise in Dublin on 17 June 1904 was at 3:33 A,M., so, depending on the cloud cover, daylight would have begun to gray things as early as 2:00A.M. Would it help to move Circe, Eumaeus, and Ithaca back an hour, as the Linati schema does, relocating Ithaca at 1:00 A.M.? That would ease the timetable from the beginning of Ithaca to first light to sunrise and almost make it believable that Molly hears the chimes of &quot;George&#39;s church&quot; ring &quot;2 o&rsquo;clock&quot; (18.1231-32[772:27-28]), but it would incredibly clog the hours from 11 :00 P.M. to 1 :00 A.M.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If elaborate efforts to establish accurate timetables tend to fairer, they also tend to mislead our attention as readers and distract us from the variety of ways Joyce imitates time. We are all aware, for example, that we can think and perceive far more in the course of a few minutes of multi-leveled consciousness than we could spell out in words in as many hours. Joyce variously explores that disparity. At 8.481 (164:23) Bloom reflects that it is &quot;five minutes&quot; since he fed the birds from O&#39;Connell Bridge, and it <em>is </em>a five minute stroll from the bridge to the front of Trinity College where Bloom is, but he feeds the birds at 8.75-76 (153:7-8), a good&nbsp;twenty minute read away. Twenty minutes of prose time is being manipulated to imitate five minutes of half-formed thought-perception time, thought-perception that could be verbalized&nbsp; but usually is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are even more radical experiments with the disparities between clock time, psychological time, and the imitation of time in the Circe and Penelope episodes. Because the Circe episode is cast in the form of a play with speeches and stage directions, we assume that reading time is approximately equal to playing time. But the reverse is the case: there is a radical disparity between reading time and playing time. For example, the hallucination at <em>Introduction 3 </em>15.1354-1956 (pp. 478-99), which we associate with Bloom, actually takes place between the two halves of Zoe&#39;s speech: &quot;Go on. Make a stump speech out of it. . . . Talk away till you&#39;re black in the face,&quot; And again at 15.2750 (527: 10), Bella Cohen, the whore mistress, enters with the line, &quot;My word! I&#39;m all of a muck sweat,&quot; and continues at 15.3500 (555:2-3), &quot;Which of you was playing the dead march from <em>Saul?&quot; </em>The implication is that the hallucinations we associate with Bloom are acted out not for his witness but for ours; what are mere blips on the screen of his consciousness are dramatized and spelled out for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Psychoanalysts I have consulted about Bloom&#39;s hallucinations say that the ones we associate with him would unfold not in the course of one night&#39;s dreams, but over a period of about two years for the average patient undergoing analysis. In other words, the hallucinations last only a moment in dramatic time but are spelled out in a dramatic imitation of epic time, the two years or so of this phase-in-the-life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Penelope episode the prose seems to imitate the way Molly might mutter to herself. Read aloud, the duration of the episode is three hours. Is that the order of time Joyce is imitating? Or is the muttering voice of the prose in turn imitating the foreshortened time and kaleidoscopic scatter of image we experience in brief spells of insomnia, an hour or less by the clock? I suspect that the Penelope episode&#39;s time is <em>more </em>like the time of hallucination and drama in Circe than it is like the time of a voice overheard and, therefore, that Molly&#39;s soliloquy belongs at <em>once </em>in the dramatic and the epic dimensions of time.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>A crucial assumption which the passage makes is that</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Option D&nbsp;obviously is possible, so would not qualify as an assumption.

And with the forfeiture of this power to enchant goes also a loss of the story&rsquo;s potential for helping the child struggle on his own, and master all by himself the problem which has made the story meaningful to him in the first place. Adult interpretations, as correct as they may be, rob the child of the opportunity to feel that he, on his own, through repeated hearing and ruminating about the story, has coped successfully with a difficult situation. We grow, we find meaning in life, and security in ourselves by having understood and solved personal problems on our own, not by having them explained to us by others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fairy-tale motifs are not neurotic symptoms, something one is better off understanding rationally so that one can rid oneself of them. Such motifs are experienced as wondrous because the child feels understood and appreciated deep down in his feelings, hopes, and anxieties, without these all having to be dragged up and investigated in the harsh light of a rationality that is still beyond him. Fairy tales enrich the child&rsquo;s life and give it an enchanted quality just because he does not quite know how the stories have worked their wonder on him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book has been written to help adults, and most especially those with children in their care, to become more fully aware of the importance of such tales. As has already been pointed out, innumerable interpretations besides those suggested in the text that follows may be pertinent; fairy tales, like all true works of art, possess a multifarious richness and depth that far transcend what even the most thorough discursive examination can extract from them. What is said in this book should be viewed as illustrative and suggestive merely. If the reader is stimulated to go beyond the surface in his own way, he will extract ever more varied personal meaning from these stories, which will then also become more meaningful to the children he may tell them to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, however, one especially crucial limitation must be noted: The true meaning and impact of a fairy tale can be appreciated, its enchantment can be experienced, only from the story in its original form. Describing the significant features of a fairy tale gives as little feeling for what it&nbsp; is all about as the listing of the events of a poem does for its appreciation. Such a description of main features, however, is all that a book like this one can provide, short of actually reprinting the stories. Since most of these fairy tales are readily available elsewhere, the hope is that this book will be read in conjunction with a re-reading of the tales discussed.* Whether it is &ldquo;Little Red Riding Hood,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cinderella,&rdquo; or any other fairy tale, only the story itself permits an appreciation of its poetic qualities, and with it an understanding of how it enriches a responsive mind.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The author takes what specific attitude in his writing?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The author clearly establishes the need to explain what motivates fairy tales.&nbsp; As such his intention is not condescending or paternalistic.&nbsp; The author is authoritative by default, but mainly interested in educating.&nbsp;As such, C is the preferable answer</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>Condescending</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Paternalistic</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>Instructive</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>Authoritative</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>A paradox the passage presents is that</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The passage explicitly states that its own interpretations of fairy tales&nbsp;are not definitive and hence can only be given as much credence as the reader might wish to grant them.&nbsp; This fundamentally undermines the writers authority.

The poem concerns isolation. In the first stanza the speaker departs and in the second finds himself alone on a beach. Moreover, the very question of whether what we see or hear is real is confronted alone, inside our own heads. Hence II. It may be argued that in the first stanza he is departing from a woman with whom he has had a love affair. However, this ignores the highly symbolic nature of the departure&ndash;it&rsquo;s about loss and ending in general. Another way to approach this is to ask yourself: when I finished reading the poem was love on my mind? Probably not. Hence I is out. Finally, being isolated and alone does not imply that you are lonely. There is no evidence in the poem that the speaker is upset by his isolation. Hence III is out.

Robert Herrick has formatted &ldquo;Delight in Disorder&rdquo; such that it reflects the poem&rsquo;s content&mdash;that is, he has deliberately inserted technical imperfections in order to create &ldquo;sweet disorder&rdquo;. For example, the lines 1 and 2, 9 and 10, 13 and 14 rhyme, however the rest are only approximate rhymes that create a sense of incompleteness, or disorder in formatting. Option II is also correct as the use of anastrophe, or the inversion of word order (e.g. a &ldquo;cuff neglectful&rdquo; rather than a neglectful cuff, or &ldquo;lawn about the shoulders thrown&rdquo; rather than lawn thrown about the shoulders&rdquo;) is a stylistic choice where words are disordered, reflected the overall theme of the poem. Option III is incorrect as the focus on women&rsquo;s clothing is arbitrary, and in of itself, it does not reflect the theme of disorder. Put simply, Herrick could have chosen any topic to write about to the same effect; therefore the focus on women&rsquo;s clothing in particular does not reinforce the theme of disorder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Hence, Answer 2 is correct.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>I</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>I and II</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>II and III</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>I, II and III</p>\r\n","correct":false}]}]},{"stem_mcq":{"title":"Unit 23","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><strong><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Applicant</span></u></strong><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">By Sylvia Plath</span></em><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">First are you our sort of person?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Do you wear<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">A glass eye, false teeth or a crutch,<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">A brace or a hook<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Rubber breasts or a rubber crotch,<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Stitches to show something&rsquo;s missing?

Three main types of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas are recognized: primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL), primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL), and primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PCLBCL), leg type.&nbsp;PCFCL, representing approximately 55% of all primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas, is the most common B-cell lymphoma to occur as a primary tumor of skin.&nbsp;PCFCL usually involves the head and neck or trunk, with solitary or grouped plaques and tumors, while multifocal skin lesions are possible. Morphologically, PCFCL exhibits a proliferation of neoplastic follicle center cells, usually a mixture of small/medium and large centrocytes (sometimes spindle-shaped type) and a variable proportion of centroblasts. Architectural pattern is variable along a continuum from follicular, nodular, sometimes focally periadnexal to diffuse growth patterns. PCFCL, even with a predominance of large cells (large centrocytes or centroblasts), has an indolent behavior characterized by a 5-year survival rate of 95% as opposed to the 41% rate of PCLBCL, leg type. Multifocal lesions do not have a poorer outcome than solitary lesions. PCFCL on the leg displays a poorer prognosis, with 5-year disease-specific survival reported at 41%. Skin relapse is observed in 30% to 45% of patients. Recurrence does not affect prognosis and is usually confined to the skin. Secondary extracutaneous dissemination may occur in 5% to 10% of cases. Furthermore, secondary skin involvement by nodal follicular lymphoma (SSIFCL) may share clinicopathologic similarities with PCFCL, especially if skin lesions are the initial manifestation of a systemic disease. Therefore, a negative staging is required to assert PCFCL and to rule out SSIFCL since both diseases require a different treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hallmark of nodal follicular lymphoma is the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation, which consists of a reciprocal translocation between the&nbsp;<em>BCL2</em>&nbsp;proto-oncogene and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (<em>IgH</em>) gene, leading to the overexpression of BCL2 protein. Therefore, the t(14;18) should be detected either by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for&nbsp;<em>BCL2-IgH</em>&nbsp;breakpoint amplification or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for either&nbsp;<em>BCL2-IgH</em>&nbsp;fusion or&nbsp;<em>BCL2</em>&nbsp;separation or split.&nbsp;</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":100},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphomas (PCFCL) account for approximately what percentage of primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCL)?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>PCFCLs account for 55% of all B-cell PCLs, whilst B-cell PCLs account for 25% of PCLs.

For practical reasons, the Australian Government might focus on income support recipients&mdash;these \u2028are the individuals over whom the government has \u2028the greatest control.

There are practical limits to what governments can do to reduce this stress.

What appears to be more important, based on the empirical evidence, is the experience of bullying or being treated unfairly. This highlights that Indigenous children have agency and autonomy. Consequently, any model \u2028of school attendance and policies that flow from it need to be child centred, and take into account the fact that Indigenous children are likely to have their own views on the costs and benefits of attending school.

Additionally, the way in which medical and mental health professionals identify and acknowledge transgenderism might further propagate healthcare access barriers for trans people. These barriers arise when eligibility criteria for specific treatments are based on a specific diagnosis, and also when patients perceive discordance between their lived experiences and a nosological interpretation of these experiences as a medical or mental disorder. In Canada, the tool used predominantly by psychiatrists and other physicians to guide diagnosis of mental health conditions is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), currently available as a text-revised fourth edition. Transgender patients generally receive the diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID), which is defined as a strong, consistent cross-gender identification accompanied by persistent discomfort with the assigned sex that is not based solely on a perceived cultural advantage of adopting the opposite sex, and not better explained by other psychiatric diagnoses. Some researchers and members of the trans community have challenged the nosological premise that transgender identity represents psychiatric pathology. Lev (2005) describes how the DSM does not allow for a healthy, functioning variant of transgenderism, and only categorises transgender experience in the context of dysfunction. Additional concerns relate to the practice of establishing GID as a precondition for medical treatment. Dominant narratives of transgender experience are reinforced by the DSM criteria for GID, but these exclude other gender variant individuals for whom transitioning treatment may be of benefit. An ethical implication extending from this is the possibility that patients feel compelled to provide disingenuous histories of their transgender identity in order to ensure treatment, should their actual experiences not align with GID criteria. The GID diagnosis often forms a part of medical and surgical transition related care, and may also influence how physicians and healthcare professionals provide non-transition care to trans patients. A formal diagnosis of GID is not considered an absolute requirement to initiate sex transitioning therapy in clinical guidelines. Nonetheless, sex transitioning therapies are generally preceded by a GID diagnosis, and clinical guidelines do advise assessment of readiness to transition by a clinician with competency in mental health. For this reason, the interaction between psychiatrists and the mental health system and physicians in other medical fields becomes important when considering healthcare barriers for trans patients</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":1},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>Lev (2005) describes which concern raised by the diagnosis of a gender identity disorder (GID)?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Lev&rsquo;s concern is that GID &lsquo;only categorises transgender experience in the context of dysfunction&rsquo;.

The attic setting invokes the struggling-artist-in-a-garret motif. The man is trying to be a nonconformist, hence he sits on the chair backwards. What a rebel!

In general, the injuries were categorized as those involving blunt force, resulting in globe rupture, vs those involving sharp forces, resulting in globe lacerations. We felt that additional categories should account for intraocular foreign bodies and perforating (through-and-through) injuries because these are specific types of open-globe injuries that differ in prognosis and management from simple rupture or penetrating injuries. Mixed injuries are those that involve multiple mechanisms. Classification of the type of injury should be based primarily on the circumstances of the injury as reported by the patient or witnesses to the incident. The injury mechanism should not be selected on the basis of other classification variables. However, in situations in which the patient is unconscious and there are no witnesses to the injury, the typing of the injury will be based on the overall findings from examination of the patient. In the case of a suspected intraocular foreign body that cannot be confirmed on clinical examination, ancillary testing such as x-ray, computed tomography, or high resolution B-scan ultrasonography should be used to rule out an intraocular foreign body. The ancillary test or tests chosen will depend on the circumstances of the injury and availability at a given center.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">The grade of the injury is based on visual acuity of the injured eye at initial examination. Testing should occur at the time of initial examination and should be attempted on injured patients who are able to cooperate. The testing can be done at distance using the Snellen acuity chart or at near with the Rosenbaum card. When possible, all testing should be done with the patient&#39;s corrective lenses, with and without pinhole. If visual acuity improves with pinhole, then this is recorded as the visual acuity at initial examination. Visual acuity of no light perception is confirmed with a bright light source, such as the indirect ophthalmoscope, set at the highest intensity while the fellow eye is completely occluded. In rare instances, visual acuity at initial examination cannot be obtained because the patient is intoxicated, comatose, or too young. In such instances, classification of the injury on this variable is impossible. Visual acuity is a physiologic variable and is limited by its subjective nature. Nevertheless, it has proven to be the strongest predictor of visual outcome in globe injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The second physiologic variable in this classification system is the assessment of a relative afferent pupillary defect. This variable grossly measures optic nerve and retinal function. The testing for a relative afferent pupillary defect should utilize the swinging flashlight test. If one pupil is mechanically or pharmacologically nonreactive or cannot be visualized because of media opacity, it can still be assessed by observing the consensual response in the fellow eye. This variable is positive when a relative afferent pupillary defect is present in the injured eye. This variable is negative when an afferent pupillary defect is absent in the injured eye. In monocular patients or patients with bilaterally fixed or unreactive pupils, the injury cannot be classified for this variable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">The zone of injury is defined by the location of the most posterior full-thickness aspect of the globe opening. Zone I injuries occur when the opening of the globe is isolated to the cornea or corneoscleral limbus. Zone II injuries are those that involve the anterior 5 mm of the sclera, so chosen because in most eyes, this location would not extend more posteriorly than the pars plana. Zone III injuries are those that extend the full thickness into the sclera more than 5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus. In cases of multiple corneoscleral openings, the zone is defined as the most posterior opening. In cases of intraocular foreign bodies, the zone is defined at the entry site, whereas in perforating injuries, the zone is defined by the most posterior defect, generally the exit site. The zone of injury can often be determined at the time of initial examination. However, the exact extent of the injury may be more accurately determined, and identification of the zone of injury revised, during the initial surgical intervention</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The classification system for mechanical injuries of the eye was chosen on the basis of its?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The answer comes from the first line, where it is stated that the method was based on variables shown to be &lsquo;prognostic of final visual outcome&rsquo;.

Reducing this profit margin for pharmacies has been the target of pricing policy in both countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All PBS-subsidised generics (branded and unbranded) are listed on &#39;F2&#39; of the PBS Schedule, which comprises off-patent originator drugs and their generic versions, and a small number of patented drugs (remaining patented originator drugs appear on F1). &#39;Price disclosure&#39; is used to set the price for all F2 drugs (with a small number of exceptions). All NHS-subsidised generics are listed on the Drug Tariff (DT). There are several different groups within the DT - namely Categories M, A and C - each associated with different pricing mechanisms. Category M is the largest group and contains popular and readily available unbranded generics, and reimbursement prices are set using &#39;price disclosure&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both countries therefore use price disclosure to set reimbursement prices for most generic drugs. This method uses data obtained from all manufacturers of a particular drug molecule to determine the sale price to pharmacies (net of incentives) weighted by volume across all doses and forms. The aim is to achieve reimbursement prices that reflect actual market prices, reducing the profit margins for pharmacies on sale of government subsidised drugs. However there are some key differences in how price disclosure is applied in each country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Australia, the price disclosure formula includes all generics (branded and unbranded) and the originator for a specific drug molecule, and the reimbursement price is therefore the same for all versions of a drug. In contrast, in England price disclosure is only used for unbranded generics, with different methods used to set prices for branded generics and originators. In&nbsp;Australia, all drugs undergo a mandatory 16% price reduction when first listed on F2, and are not subject to further price reductions until the first price disclosure cycle to obtain price data is complete, which takes at least 18 months (there is a mandated 12-month period of data collection and 6 months of calculations). In England there are no mandatory price cuts on listing of a generic in Category M; however, adjustments to reimbursement prices based on price disclosure calculations occur immediately, often resulting in rapid price reductions. Subsequent price adjustments are made three times a year in&nbsp;Australia, while they are made quarterly in England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>Market size and share</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is limited publicly available information about the Australian and English generics industry, making it difficult to fully appreciate the market dynamics or terms of trade in the supply chain. Although the potential consumer market for generics is obviously much larger in England compared with&nbsp;Australia due to differences in population size, generics&#39; share of the local pharmaceutical markets in the UK is also much larger than&nbsp;Australia by value and volume (10.2% v. 18.5% value, 30% v. 67.4% volume). Unlike Australia, the UK is considered to be a highly competitive market and attractive for generic suppliers. The number of suppliers is much greater in the UK (at least 22 manufacturers and around 34 wholesalers) compared with&nbsp;Australia (10 and at least 5). Analysis is complicated by the relationship between originator and generics manufacturers, with many engaging in the production of &#39;pseudo-generics&#39; - repackaged versions of the originator sold under a generic name by a subsidiary of the originator company or cross-licenced to a generics supplier. Approximately 18% of Australian generics fall into this category, and it is uncertain how many do so in the UK.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>What is described as the main target of government pricing policy in both England and Australia?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p><strong>Option B is correct.&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The first paragraph provides that the main target of policy pricing is to reduce pharmacies profit margin from the difference in reimbursement price and actual purchase price.

Answer C, whilst reflecting a difference in pricing, likely makes the Australian reimbursement price lower (by decreasing the recognised manufacturer&rsquo;s sale price) and hence decreases the profit margin of Australian pharmacists.

The term redox is derived from the two complementary processes which occur in the reaction, reduction and oxidation. Reduction is defined as gain&nbsp;of electrons and oxidation refers to&nbsp;loss&nbsp;of electrons. A galvanic cell operates by splitting these two reactions into what are termed half-cells. Doing so&nbsp;forces the electrons which are normally transferred between the reduction and oxidation reactions to first traverse an electrical circuit. Thus galvanic cells are capable of providing electrical energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Half-cells are comprised of electrodes bathed in a solution. For example, a silver half-cell will have an electrode made of silver immersed in a solution containing silver ions. An electric potential is produced by connecting two half-cells with different reduction potentials.

One method to reduce oxidation of these tanks is to connect them via an insulated wire to what is often referred to as a &ldquo;sacrificial electrode&rdquo;. If a tank is primarily composed of iron, what material would be most effective as a sacrificial electrode?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>This question states that we want to prevent the oxidation (losing of electrons) by iron tanks. Thus, we need to connect the tanks to a material that is more readily oxidized than iron to complete the galvanic cell. Of the options listed, only zinc meets this criterion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this answer is not readily apparent, it can be arrived at by considering how each of the combinations would act as a cell. In the case of iron and silver, silver has a higher reduction potential than iron. Silver would then be reduced and iron oxidized. Copper is slightly more complicated - its reduction potential falls between that of Fe<sup>3+</sup>and Fe<sup>2+</sup>. What this means though is that whilst copper would prevent the formation of Fe<sup>3+</sup>, it would accelerate&nbsp;the formation of Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Using iron as a sacrificial electrode would not be particularly useful as the standard potential of the cell would be 0V and so its oxidation would not be favoured over the fuel tank. This leaves zinc, which is the only metal that would be preferentially oxidized over the iron storage tank.

Losing acid makes the body more alkaline = higher pH. The passage states that pH is tightly regulated and that outside of those ranges a person can become very ill. One of the first signs of respiratory alkalosis (altitude sickness) is dizziness. Students should be able to answer the question by extracting this amount of information from the passage. An extended explanation is that: because the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide is much lower than that of alveolar, especially at high altitudes, breathing faster promotes the alveolar partial pressure to approach that of atmospheric. This creates a greater concentration gradient for carbon dioxide to leave the blood for the alveoli, promoting more rapid loss of acid from the body.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He would not be inhaling more carbon dioxide despite the increased rate of breathing because of the lower concentration of carbon dioxide particles at the higher altitude (this concept is suggested in question 1).&nbsp;</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>The pH of his body is increasing&nbsp;</p>\r\n","correct":true},{"description":"<p>He is exhaling less carbon dioxide</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>He is inhaling more carbon dioxide</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>The pH of his body is decreasing&nbsp;</p>\r\n","correct":false}]},{"description":"<p>Emphysema is a disease of the lungs in which the alveolar walls are destroyed.

The number of co-ordination sites (i.e. where the ligand attaches to), determines the overall shape of the complex; the most common shape being an octahedral complex where there are 6 co-ordination sites as below. There are&nbsp;2 axial positions above and below the centre atom and 4 equatorial positions going into and out of the page, and where adjacent bonds are at an angle of 90 degrees: Note that the axial and equatorial positions are equivalent to one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://gradready-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/ckeditor/picture/data/55af84663f2a81b6c200007d/content_octahedral_complex.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 209px;\" /></p>\r\n","tag":"CHE10 Stereochemistry and projections","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or EDTA, has the following molecular structure:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://gradready-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/ckeditor/picture/data/55af84893f2a81f609000071/content_EDTA.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 120px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">How many donor atoms are present on each EDTA molecule in a solution of EDTA?&nbsp;</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Donor atoms have a lone pair that can be donated to the central metal atom.

In what order do the three friends begin running?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>In order to answer this question, the candidate must understand the concept of interference as it applies to the interaction between waves from two point sources. It is indicated in the question that the runners will only begin when they hear a tone at the maximum amplitude that can be produced by both speakers together. This will occur at points where the sound waves propagating from each speaker are in phase. We must therefore determine in whether the runners are at points where total constructive interference occurs when the speakers generate each of the three tones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to answer this, we may use the concept of path difference. Maximum constructive interference occurs when the phase difference between two waves is `0^o` or zero wavelengths. Conversely, maximum destructive interference occurs when the phase difference between two waves is `180^o` or half a wavelength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To determine the kind of interference that occurs at a given point, we&nbsp;convert the displacement of that point from each point of sound origin into terms of wavelengths. For example, a sound wave with a wavelength of `5m` will travel 4 wavelengths in `20m`. If the path difference between the displacements of the point from the two wave sources is an integer, then the waves are in-phase at that point. If the path difference is an integer `+ 0.5` then the waves are out of phase by `180^o` and experience total destructive interference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First convert the frequencies emitted by the speakers to wavelengths using the above equation:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">`c=lambdaxxf` rearranges to `lambda=c/f`</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">`lambda_1=350/350=1m`</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">`lambda_2=350/700=0.5m`</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">`lambda_3=350/2800=0.125m`</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Then work out the difference in displacement from each speaker for each runner:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Yelena:</strong> `Deltas_{:&quot;Yelena&quot;:}=128.82-102.32=26.5m`</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Oliver:</strong> is at position (50,100), which means he is an equal distance from each speaker.

The significance of air in the chamber is two-fold. It increases the total number of moles of gas and it also provides kinetic energy.

As it comes relatively early, there are a couple of ways to approach this question. The fastest way to solve this question requires some background knowledge. Sodium is found in the s-block of the periodic table (the first two columns). These are the elements which have their outermost electrons in an s orbital. Already then, the first two quantum numbers are provided. n = 3 as sodium is in the third energy level and \u2113 = 0 because that is the number which corresponds to an s-orbital.

These insoluble immune complexes then leave the blood; their unique nature prevents phagocytosis and/or degradation and promotes inflammation of the surrounding tissue.

Each nephron consists of a glomerulus (capillary bundle) and a renal tubule. The glomerular capsule is the end of the tubule surrounding the glomerulus. The filtration membrane lies between the blood of the glomerulus and the interior of the capsule. Its three layers are the fenestrated capillaries of the glomerulus (1), the membrane of the capsule, made of podocytes (2), and the intervening basement membrane (3). Podocytes are modified epithelial cells with branching foot processes. The gaps between the foot processes are known as filtration slits, through which filtrate from plasma must pass to enter the capsule. The remainder of the renal tubule has three main segments: (1) proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), (2) loop of Henle, and (3) distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Filtrate passes through these segments in order before draining into the collecting ducts to end up in the bladder as urine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glomerular filtration is a passive process, relying on the hydrostatic pressure of blood to force filtrate through the membrane. Only substances small enough to pass through the gaps in the filtration membrane make it into the filtrate in the capsule. Filtrate contains everything found in blood plasma except proteins. Much of the filtrate needs to be reabsorbed to maintain blood volume and constituents. Virtually all organic nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids, are reabsorbed. The reabsorption of water and ions is regulated by hormones. For nearly every substance that is actively reabsorbed, there is a transport maximum (T<sub>m</sub>), reflecting the number of transport proteins for that substance in the renal tubules. When these carriers are saturated, the excess substance is excreted in urine. The T<sub>m</sub>&nbsp;for glucose is 180 mg/100 mL of plasma, and is not normally reached in healthy individuals due to the effectiveness of insulin in regulating blood glucose levels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://gradready-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/ckeditor/picture/data/5590b8753f2a8111da00001f/content_plasma_glucose_concentration_redrawn.jpg\" style=\"width: 362px; height: 400px;\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://gradready-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/ckeditor/picture/data/5590bab73f2a8111da000027/content_nephron_fluid_volume_redrawn.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 300px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, the PCT reabsorbs all glucose and amino acids from the filtrate, as well as most of the water and sodium. The loop of Henle also reabsorbs a significant amount of water and sodium. Because more sodium than water is reabsorbed here, the filtrate is diluted as it passes through the loop. Absorption of water and sodium at the DCT is primarily hormone-dependent: antidiuretic hormone (ADH) produced by the pituitary gland promotes the reabsorption of water; aldosterone produced by the adrenal glands promotes the reabsorption of sodium. Waste products, such as ammonium, are secreted into the filtrate at the DCT.

As articulated during the 2007 conference from which it takes its name, speculative realism encompasses an entire spectrum of philosophies &ldquo;committed to upholding the autonomy of reality &hellip; against the depredations of anthropocentrism&rdquo; (Brassier et al. 306).&nbsp;After a century of phenomenological and deconstructive investigations into consciousness and language, speculative realists take seriously the metaphysical claim that the world exists, independent of the mind and its perceptions. At the same time, in contesting all forms of relativism or anti-realism, they are joined in an appreciation of what Graham Harman calls &ldquo;the strangeness of the real: a strangeness undetectable by the instruments of common sense&rdquo; (Quentin viii). Speculative realists speak of reality in surprising, even uncanny, ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skeptics have dismissed speculative realism as everything from the philosophical form of neoliberal economics to the dangerous renouncing of all political alignment.&nbsp;In this essay, I will argue not only for its philosophical importance, but also for its potential to reshape debate about &ldquo;nature&rdquo; in literary studies. My investigation therefore turns to romanticism, a literary and philosophical movement defined by its sustained reflection on the concept. Reading speculative realism through romanticism, and vice versa, suggests that much remains to be said about nature, even in its romantic instantiation &ndash; which turns out to be less familiar than we might have thought. It also shows how nearly our present theoretical moment hews to a <span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">certain romanticism.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For most speculative realists, the tradition of modern anti-realism begins with Kant&rsquo;s epistemology. Responding to Hume&rsquo;s skeptical attack on the uniformity of nature, Kant established the possibility of empirical realism by grounding it in a transcendental idealism. According to the familiar story, the Kantian revolution ensured the validity and coherence of our phenomenal experiences, but at the cost of transforming things in themselves into mere logical placeholders. After Kant, dogmatic speculation about the world in itself is supplanted by critical inquiry into the conditions under which experience of the world is possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story is hardly new. More strikingly, though, the speculative realists insist that this transcendental procedure provides the basis for nearly all forms of modern thought. This poses major challenges for a renewed realism, since any contemporary thinking about the nature of reality begins with what Iain Hamilton Grant terms &ldquo;the excision of the &lsquo;in itself&rsquo; from metaphysics&rdquo;. Grant draws on the work of F.W.J. Schelling, who declared in Kant&rsquo;s immediate wake that nature does not exist for modern philosophy. Replacing ontology with the transcendental analytic and cosmology with the transcendental dialectic, Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;anti-physics&rdquo; forecloses on speculation about the in-itself or its origins.

Despite the critical nature of these competencies in practice, the teaching of communication skills to medical students is often informal, either through an apprenticeship model without formal feedback or through the hidden curriculum. The literature addressing communication skills in medical education often focuses on verbal communication between the physician and the patient. Few studies address the important facets of communication that involve the synthesis of historical information into written admission notes, leading to a paucity of information on best practices. Written documentation of an initial patient encounter, referred to as a consultation notes, represents a complex, multifaceted task in which a student must collect, organise and synthesise a wealth of information from a patient interaction. The written case presentation is a fundamental skill across all disciplines in medicine and a necessary competency for students to achieve in medical training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been previously reported that medical students largely learn communication skills through trial and error, and that they rely heavily on feedback from residents and staff physicians to refine their abilities. A key setting for developing these skills is during on-call shifts, where students communicate directly with residents and staff about specific patient encounters. The feedback and instruction that students receive on their written documentation during and immediately following a call shift are highly dependent on several factors, including the available time for supervising residents or staff to give directed instruction, the resident or staff comfort with delivering constructive feedback, as well as staff and resident preferences as to what written documentation should include. Such variables result in a heterogeneous mixture of medical student competency and comfort with oral and written communication at the end of rotations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many medical schools in Canada attempt to facilitate feedback on communication skills using encounter cards. Encounter cards are portable evaluation tools for a specific skill (eg, history taking, physical examination (PE), etc) and are used following the assessor observing the student in a clinical encounter. Encounter cards have permitted some assessment of communication abilities but their use has not been shown to result in improvement of medical student&#39;s oral presentation or written communication skills.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":1},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>Which aspect of training medical students in communication is of most concern to the author</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The article mostly addresses concerns regarding student competency arising from variables in clinical communication training.

But being educated by photographs is not like being educated by older, more artisanal images. For one thing, there are a great many more images around, claiming our attention. The inventory started in 1839 and since then just about everything has been photographed, or so it seems. This very insatiability of the photographing eye changes the terms of confinement in the cave, our world. In teaching us a new visual code, photographs alter and enlarge our notions of what is worth looking at and what we have a right to observe. They are a grammar and, even more importantly, an ethics of seeing. Finally, the most grandiose result of the photographic enterprise is to give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads -- as an anthology of images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To collect photographs is to collect the world. Movies and television programs light up walls, flicker, and go out; but with still photographs the image is also an object, lightweight, cheap to produce, easy to carry about, accumulate, store. In Godard&#39;s Les Carabiniers (1963), two sluggish lumpen-peasants are lured into joining the King&#39;s Army by the promise that they will be able to loot, rape, kill, or do whatever else they please to the enemy, and get rich. But the suitcase of booty that Michel-Ange and Ulysse triumphantly bring home, years later, to their wives turns out to contain only picture postcards, hundreds of them, of Monuments, Department Stores, Mammals, Wonders of Nature, Methods of Transport, Works of Art, and other classified treasures from around the globe.

Transgender women had odds of HIV infection 49 times greater than the general population. A separate meta-analysis of HIV among transgender women sex workers found that these women had a pooled HIV prevalence of 27%, compared with 15% among transgender women who did not engage in sex work. Of note, no countries in Eastern Europe or the continent of Africa had published HIV prevalence data on transgender women at the time of these studies. Country reports in UNAIDS Gap Report 2014 suggest that HIV prevalence among transgender women sex workers is nine times higher than for non-transgender female sex workers and three times higher than for male sex workers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many studies have demonstrated multiple co-occurring health problems among transgender women, including high rates of violence and victimization, substance use, sexual abuse and assault, and depression with suicidal ideation and attempts. This syndemic&nbsp;is associated with structural and social inequalities such as widespread stigma and discrimination, lack of access to identity documents that match gender expression, high prevalence of unemployment and underemployment, street-based sex work with low pay and no legal protections, homelessness and lack of access to health services, included gender-affirming care. Many transgender women have partners who are at high risk for HIV. Transgender women who seek psychological affirmation of their gender from partners may be more willing to have condomless sex, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transgender men</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All published studies on HIV prevalence among transgender men are from North America, and they suggest a lesser burden of disease than among transgender women. The most recently published meta-analysis found only two studies with laboratory-confirmed HIV status among transgender men. One of the studies found no infections among participants, and the other found a prevalence of 2%, amounting to one HIV-positive study participant. Emerging data among transgender men who have sex with men raises the possibility that this subpopulation faces heightened vulnerability to HIV . Limited data suggest that mental health concerns are common among transgender men. It is unclear if and how mental health concerns among transgender men might affect their vulnerability to HIV.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>According to the passage above, which of the following statements are true of transgender women?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I.

This question is of great practical significance, as it brings into focus&mdash;for corporate boards and overall society&mdash;the potential importance of executives&rsquo; preferences in shaping the actions and outcomes of our large economic enterprises. Additionally, this question helps to frame some incompatibilities, or at least tensions, between major theoretical frameworks. Under the logic of neoclassical economics, for example, firms act on the basis of contextual conditions (e.g., markets, competition, technologies), with managers playing little or no role. Similarly, according to new institutional theory and some renditions of population ecology theory, managers are so constrained by isomorphic and inertial forces as to have only a minor influence over organizational outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, agency theory is centered on a two-part premise: managers&nbsp;<em>can</em>significantly inject their personal preferences into corporate policies; the challenge for owners is to prevent this from occurring. According to the theory, managers are inclined toward some common, essentially universal tendencies&mdash;including empire-building, nest-feathering, risk-aversion, and shirking&mdash;which serve their own but not owners&rsquo; interests. Owners can ameliorate this &ldquo;agency problem&rdquo; by installing appropriate monitoring and incentive schemes. Any heterogeneity observed in company practices or performance can thus be traced to differences in governance arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet another perspective, often set forth under the rubric of upper echelons theory, similarly allows for substantial executive influence but proposes that executives vary in the personal orientations they bring to their decisions. According to the theory, strategic decision making is not so much a technical endeavor as an interpretive one, and executives perceive their situations and alternatives through highly personalized lenses, which are formed by their experiences, personalities, and values. In turn, these individualized construals shape executives&rsquo; choices. In contrast to agency theory, then, upper echelons theory posits that heterogeneity in companies&rsquo; actions or outcomes is due to differences among company leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Values can be expected to enter into executives&rsquo; choices through two conduits. Even though we are not able to empirically observe these two mechanisms, it is useful to explicate them. First, an executive&rsquo;s values may have a direct influence on his or her choices. After weighing available alternatives, facts, probabilities, and eventualities, the executive selects a course of action that suits his or her values.&nbsp;England (1967) referred to this direct influence of values on action as &ldquo;behavior channeling.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second mechanism, which we envision as far more prevalent, occurs when values affect choices indirectly, through &ldquo;perceptual filtering&rdquo;. Under this process, the executive selectively searches for information that suits his or her values and then perceives and interprets information in a values-congruent way. Through the interpretive process that psychologists refer to as &ldquo;motivated cognition&rdquo;, executives see what they want to see and hear what they want to hear. Just as motivated cognition causes long-tenured executives to see great instrumental merit in the status quo, so too will CEOs&rsquo; values shape their assessments of the potential efficacy of various corporate actions, including CSR initiatives</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>What is NOT a hypothesized mechanism by which CEO&rsquo;s individual values affect their decision-making?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The answer is found in the final two paragraphs, which outline the two conduits through which values enter CEOs decision.

This year history gate-crashed modern America in the form of a 150-year-old document: a few sheets of paper that compelled Hollywood actor Ben Affleck to issue a public apology and forced the highly regarded US public service broadcaster PBS to launch an internal investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was precisely because slaves were reduced to property that they appear so regularly in historic documents, both in the US and in Britain. As property, slaves were listed in plantation accounts and itemised in inventories. They were recorded for tax reasons and detailed alongside other transferable goods on the pages of thousands of wills. Few historical documents cut to the reality of slavery more than lists of names written alongside monetary values. It is now almost two decades since I had my first encounter with British plantation records, and I still feel a surge of emotion when I come across entries for slave children who, at only a few months old, have been ascribed a value in sterling; the sale of children and the separation of families was among the most bitterly resented aspects of an inhuman system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slavery resurfaces in America regularly. The disadvantage and discrimination that disfigures the lives and limits the life chances of so many African-Americans is the bitter legacy of the slave system and the racism that underwrote and outlasted it. Britain, by contrast, has been far more successful at covering up its slave-owning and slave-trading past. Whereas the cotton plantations of the American south were established on the soil of the continental United States, British slavery took place 3,000 miles away in the Caribbean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That geographic distance made it possible for slavery to be largely airbrushed out of British history, following the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833. Many of us today have a more vivid image of American slavery than we have of life as it was for British-owned slaves on the plantations of the Caribbean. The word slavery is more likely to conjure up images of Alabama cotton fields and whitewashed plantation houses, of&nbsp;<em>Roots</em>,&nbsp;<em>Gone With The Wind</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>12 Years A Slave,</em>&nbsp;than images of Jamaica or Barbados in the 18th century. This is not an accident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history of British slavery has been buried. The thousands of British families who grew rich on the slave trade, or from the sale of slave-produced sugar, in the 17th and 18th centuries, brushed those uncomfortable chapters of their dynastic stories under the carpet. Today, across the country, heritage plaques on Georgian townhouses describe former slave traders as &ldquo;West India merchants&rdquo;, while slave owners are hidden behind the equally euphemistic term &ldquo;West India planter&rdquo;. Thousands of biographies written in celebration of notable 17th and 18th-century Britons have reduced their ownership of human beings to the footnotes, or else expunged such unpleasant details altogether. The&nbsp;<em>Dictionary of National Biography</em>&nbsp;has been especially culpable in this respect. Few acts of collective forgetting have been as thorough and as successful as the erasing of slavery from the Britain&rsquo;s &ldquo;island story&rdquo;. If it was geography that made this great forgetting possible, what completed the disappearing act was our collective fixation with the one redemptive chapter in the whole story. William Wilberforce and the abolitionist crusade, first against the slave trade and then slavery itself, has become a figleaf behind which the larger, longer and darker history of slavery has been concealed.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":1},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>Unlike America, Britain</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The article discusses how Britain has been more successful than America in hiding the details of its historical role in slavery.

European countries are classified according to two types of institutional settings for confronting organ transplant needs: informed consent (opt-in) or presumed consent (opt-out). In countries with informed consent or &#39;opt-in&#39; legislation, such as the UK, Germany, and Sweden, an individual or his/her family must give explicit permission for organ removal. Presumed consent countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Austria, assume universal consent without explicit registration otherwise. The latter is more prominent in the EU although countries with presumed consent legislation can differ in enforcement levels. Enforced presumed consent policy means that individuals who have not opted out of organ donation will automatically donate their organs upon time of death if organs are in a suitable clinical condition. Otherwise, unenforced presumed consent policies have caveats such as allowing relatives to refuse their relative&#39;s organ donation even though the relative has not explicitly opted-out.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In practice, most families are consulted with regard to a deceased relative&#39;s organ donation even if this relative has already expressed willingness to be a donor. Approximately half of families in the US and 42 percent of families in the UK refuse requests for the donation of a relative&#39;s organ in comparison to 20 percent objecting to donation in Spain. Compared to an individual&#39;s decision to donate their own organs, there are limited studies examining the determinants of willingness to consent to the donation of a deceased family member&#39;s organs. Just as Bowles finds that institutional setting prompts individuals to display certain preferences, we expect that organ donation policy will have an impact on individuals&#39; propensities to donate their own organs and those of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">While organ donation policies might impact donor rates, individual attitudes regarding donations are not always aligned with donation behavior. Though European surveys show widespread public support for organ donation, donor card signing (opt-in) does not reflect this opinion. In Germany, only 7&ndash;10 percent of individuals who are in favor of organ donation carry a donor card. Only 19 percent of all adults in the UK have registered on the national donor registry.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">However, an individual&#39;s willingness to donate (WTD) is an expression of the intention to pursue a behavior; therefore WTD provides a better indication of donation rates in a country than simply support of organ donation. Individuals can express favor towards organ donation as an abstract concept for society to encourage but they may not be reflecting how they feel about donation for themselves or a family member.</span></p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>According to the wording of the policies, an&nbsp;individual who (whether in their own capacity or through their family)&nbsp;makes no declaration regarding the permissibility of donating their organs</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>For an opt-in system, the individual or his or her family must give explicit consent for the organs to be donated.

The potential effect of this on an individual&rsquo;s decisions is demonstrated by the relatively low rejection rates of organ donation in Spain, compared to the higher rejection rates of organ donation in the UK and US.

You know what I mean. And the trees all died. They were orange trees. I don&rsquo;t know why they died, they just died. Something wrong with the soil possibly or maybe the stuff we got from the nursery wasn&rsquo;t the best. We complained about it. So we&rsquo;ve got thirty kids there, each kid had his or her own little tree to plant and we&rsquo;ve got these thirty dead trees. All these kids looking at these little brown sticks, it was depressing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t have been so bad except that just a couple of weeks before the thing with the trees, the snakes all died. But I think that the snakes &ndash; well, the reason that the snakes kicked off was that ... you remember, the boiler was shut off for four days because of the strike, and that was explicable. It was something you could explain to the kids because of the strike. I mean, none of their parents would let them cross the picket line and they knew there was a strike going on and what it meant. So when things got started up again and we found the snakes they weren&rsquo;t too disturbed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the herb gardens it was probably a case of overwatering, and at least now they know not to overwater. The children were very conscientious with the herb gardens and some of them probably ... you know, slipped them a little extra water when we weren&rsquo;t looking. Or maybe ... well, I don&rsquo;t like to think about sabotage, although it did occur to us. I mean, it was something that crossed our minds. We were thinking that way probably because before that the gerbils had died, and the white mice had died, and the salamander ... well, now they know not to carry them around in plastic bags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course we expected the tropical fish to die, that was no surprise. Those numbers, you look at them crooked and they&rsquo;re belly-up on the surface. But the lesson plan called for a tropical fish input at that point, there was nothing we could do, it happens every year, you just have to hurry past it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We weren&rsquo;t even supposed to have a puppy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We weren&rsquo;t even supposed to have one, it was just a puppy the Murdoch girl found under a Gristede&rsquo;s truck one day and she was afraid the truck would run over it when the driver had finished making his delivery, so she stuck it in her knapsack and brought it to the school with her. So we had this puppy. As soon as I saw the puppy I thought, Oh Christ, I bet it will live for about two weeks and then... And that&rsquo;s what it did. It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be in the classroom at all, there&rsquo;s some kind of regulation about it, but you can&rsquo;t tell them they can&rsquo;t have a puppy when the puppy is already there, right in front of them, running around on the floor and yap yap yapping. They named it Edgar &ndash; that is, they named it after me. They had a lot of fun running after it and yelling, &ldquo;Here, Edgar! Nice Edgar!&rdquo; Then they&rsquo;d laugh like hell. They enjoyed the ambiguity. I enjoyed it myself. I don&rsquo;t mind being kidded. They made a little house for it in the supply closet and all that. I don&rsquo;t know what it died of. Distemper, I guess. It probably hadn&rsquo;t had any shots. I got it out of there before the kids got to school. I checked the supply closet each morning, routinely, because I knew what was going to happen.

Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.

We may not like what we see, but-as the kickball saga will show-it&#39;s the way we&#39;ve always been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americans have long lived by two propositions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Proposition Number One</em>: You&#39;re no better than I am.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equality is our religion, as Alexis de Tocqueville noted. We may not be equal in income, wealth, or talent. But we categorically reject the idea that people are automatically better or worse merely because they belong to some class or group. Tocqueville found that, unlike Europe, there was no natural aristocracy in America. Everyone is supposed to have the same opportunity. This was our national ideal (and mythology) in the 1830s. It remains so today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Proposition Number Two</em>: You can&#39;t do that to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since at least the Boston Tea Party, Americans have resented arbitrary authority. We have the Bill of Rights to define the limits of outside control over individual conduct. We react strongly against what we regard as intrusions into our lives, whether by government, bureaucracy (private and public), or other groups and individuals. Liberals defend &quot;rights.&quot; Conservatives exalt &quot;freedom.&quot; They&#39;re really talking about the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let it be said that these have been-and are-sources of American greatness. They nurture love of liberty, a respect for the individual, and a healthy sensitivity to the abuse of power. But these same impulses can get out of hand. Unless somehow tempered, they can lead to absurd and wasteful conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a more traditional society, Reba Martineau would have received some deference merely because she is 88. Not in America. The old aren&#39;t superior simply because they&#39;re old. We won&#39;t have an aristocracy of age or anything else. After &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;dog,&quot; American children first learn to say: &quot;It&#39;s not fair.&quot; They think they&#39;re as good as anyone else, and they&#39;re encouraged to believe it...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...What <i>Time</i> describes as &quot;victimology&quot; - the idea that your problems are always someone else&#39;s fault-derives from the same values. They are a wellspring for economic, social, racial, sexual, and personal resentment. They provide a ready-made escape from individual responsibility. We&#39;re all equal, right? Well, if we&#39;re not, then why not? Who&#39;s to blame? Every group of individuals that&#39;s dissatisfied with life looks for the villain who stole the American dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These questions are often fair and legitimate. Social conditions constantly change. Our society is and always will be imperfect. It can&#39;t improve itself if no one challenges the status quo. Nor is every lawsuit frivolous. But the trouble is that virtuous American values are increasingly unrestrained by custom, tradition, or common sense. In a bureaucratic and legalized society, there are many points for complaint and pressure. Television and print media provide ample opportunity for publicity and self-expression. Almost everyone can go somewhere to pout about something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What has gotten us into trouble is the boundless belief in our own national rhetoric. Our virtues, when taken to excess, become vices. They breed self-pity, self-delusion, and pointless conflict. The old American character hasn&#39;t died. It&#39;s just grown a bit silly.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":100},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>From the author&#39;s perspective, the &quot;American national character&quot; is:</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Option B is correct.

Although currently lower than in Europe and the USA, the burden of cancer in the Middle East is increasing, and is predicted to almost double by 2030. This increase is due, in part, to longer lifespans and adoption of western lifestyle habits (eg, greater use of tobacco; consumption of high-fat, low-fibre diets; and greater physical inactivity). The countries that form the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC)&mdash;Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait&mdash;are expected to be at the higher end of these predictions for the region, while also being faced with a high burden of infectious diseases. The meeting culminated in a declaration to be submitted for endorsement by the Executive Board of the Health Ministers Council for the GCC States, which listed areas in need of attention and called on member states to reduce cancer mortality by 25% between 2015 and 2025. But can this ambitious target be achieved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although GCC countries cannot be described as being of low-to-middle income&mdash;they are perhaps more accurately described as industrialising&mdash;they share many of the same barriers to universal health care that face developing countries. At a systems level, inadequate registration of cancer incidence and death prevents an accurate measure of the burden of the disease, thus hindering proper planning of national and regional cancer-control programmes. Efforts to improve disease registration are underway in the region, but there is still some way to go. Region-specific research is clearly needed to better understand the differences in underlying tumour biology that, for instance, result in about half of cancers in the region presenting at an early age, and to investigate why the pattern of malignancies diagnosed in the Gulf differs from that elsewhere (eg, haematological malignancies, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphomas, are very common in the GCC, possibly as a result of the high prevalence of consanguineous marriages in the region).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, distinct national cancer plans do not exist for all countries in the region. Some countries, such as Qatar, have taken useful steps forward with the launch of a National Cancer Strategy and a National Cancer Research Strategy, but such action is not universal. Additionally, primary care is generally geared towards acute care rather than chronic diseases, whereas in terms of secondary care, cancer treatment facilities are limited in number and of variable quality. To address the low number of facilities would need investment and detailed consideration of the geographical and personal financial barriers that exist for large proportions of the population. There is a growing interest in improving health infrastructure in the region&mdash;eg, medical centres of excellence such as King Abdulaziz Medical City in Saudi Arabia are being developed. However, where funding exists, it must be used wisely&mdash;eg, is there really a need to build four proton therapy facilities in Saudi Arabia when the country has only half the required number of linear accelerators for its population?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the population and patient level, cultural barriers and educational issues, which together contribute to poor awareness of the disease and of health care in general, must be addressed. Primary prevention measures to successfully reduce exposure to risk factors (eg, tobacco use, poor diet, and little physical activity) are needed. Breaking down social taboos about cancer is also a priority for both primary and secondary prevention&mdash;region-specific research into methods to overcome these barriers is vital. Access to essential palliative drugs is restricted in the region, a situation that is unjustifiable, particularly given that most cancers present late and in non-curable stages. Lastly, the provision of universal health care in all Gulf countries should be mandatory: health is a human right, and the rights of all patients to both treatment and psychosocial support are paramount. The disproportionate distribution of wealth in the region is a substantial hurdle to accessing care for a large part of the population, which hinders efforts towards universal care.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>Which of the following is NOT listed as a barrier to universal health care in the Middle East</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Whilst all four answers are mentioned in the passage, only three are listed as barriers to universal health care.

Nothing could be more obvious or less in need of explanation. Is such concern morally out of place when applied to fish, or are we silly to have such unquestioning concern about dogs? Is the suffering of a drawn-out death something that is cruel to inflict on any animal that can experience it, or just some animals?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Can the familiarity of the animals we have come to know as companions be a guide to us as we think about the animals we eat? Just how distant are fish (or cows, pigs, or chickens) from us in the scheme of life? Is it a chasm or a tree that defines the distance? Are nearness and distance even relevant? If we were to one day encounter a form of life more powerful and intelligent than our own, and it regarded us as we regard fish, what would be our argument against being eaten?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">The lives of billions of animals a year and the health of the largest ecosystems on our planet hang on the thinly reasoned answers we give to these questions. Such global concerns can themselves feel distant, though. We care most about what&rsquo;s close to us, and have a remarkably easy time forgetting everything else. We also have a strong impulse to do what others around us are doing, especially when it comes to food. Food ethics are so complex because food is bound to both taste buds and&nbsp;<em>taste,</em>&nbsp;to individual biographies and social histories. The choice-obsessed modern West is probably more accommodating to individuals who choose to eat differently than any culture has ever been, but ironically, the utterly unselective omnivore &mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m easy; I&rsquo;ll eat anything&rdquo; &mdash; can appear more socially sensitive than the individual who tries to eat in a way that is good for society. Food choices are determined by many factors, but reason (even consciousness) is not generally high on the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">There is something about eating animals that tends to polarize: never eat them or never sincerely question eating them; become an activist or disdain activists. These opposing positions &mdash; and the closely related unwillingness to take a position &mdash; converge in suggesting that eating animals matters. If and how we eat animals cuts to something deep. Meat is bound up with the story of who we are and who we want to be, from the book of Genesis to the latest farm bill. It raises significant philosophical questions and is a $140 billion&ndash;plus a year industry that occupies nearly a third of the land on the planet, shapes ocean ecosystems, and may well determine the future of earth&rsquo;s climate. And yet we seem able to think only about the edges of the arguments &mdash; the logical extremes rather than the practical realities. My grandmother said she wouldn&rsquo;t eat pork to save her life, and though the context of her story is as extreme as it gets, many people seem to fall back on this all-or-nothing framework when discussing their everyday food choices. It&rsquo;s a way of thinking that we would never apply to other ethical realms. (Imagine always or never lying.) I can&rsquo;t count the times that upon telling someone I am vegetarian, he or she responded by pointing out an inconsistency in my lifestyle or trying to find a flaw in an argument I never made. (I have often felt that my vegetarianism matters more to such people than it does to me.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">We need a better way to talk about eating animals. We need a way that brings meat to the center of public discussion in the same way it is often at the center of our plates. This doesn&rsquo;t require that we pretend we are going to have collective agreement. However strong our intuitions are about what&rsquo;s right for us personally and even about what&rsquo;s right for others, we all know in advance that our positions will clash with those of our neighbors. What do we do with that most inevitable reality? Drop the conversation, or find a way to reframe it?&nbsp;</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">According to the first three paragraphs, what does the author argue is the principal point of separation between companion animals and fish?</span></p>\r\n","explanation":"<div class=\"explanation\" style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px;\"><em>Although the author does talk about the differing levels of intelligence and evolution that may exist between fish and other animals, he also equates fish with potentially higher beings such as chickens, pigs and cows, some of which may be as intelligent as companion animals.

The knee, hip, and hand are most affected by the disease. Osteoarthritis becomes more common with age, and after age 50 years more women than men are affected. For example, the Rotterdam study of a population-based cohort of 3906 people 55 years or older reported that 67% of women and 55% of men had radiographic osteoarthritis of the hand. In people older than 80 years, 53% of women and 33% of men had radiographic osteoarthritis of the knee. The age-standardised and sex-standardised incidence of osteoarthritis of the hand is 100 per 100,000 person-years, for the hip is 88 per 100 000 person-years, and for the knee is 240 per 100 000 person-years.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Osteoarthritis in general develops progressively over several years, although symptoms might remain stable for long periods within this period.

Risk factors for occurrence and progression of osteoarthritis have been identified, and differ on the basis of the joints involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main characteristics of osteoarthritis are changes in the subchondral bone. Osteophyte formation, bone remodelling, subchondral sclerosis, and attrition are crucial for radiological diagnosis. Several of these bone changes take place not only during the final stage of the disease, but also at the onset of the disease &mdash;possibly before cartilage degradation. This finding led to the suggestion that subchondral bone could initiate cartilage damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pain is the first and predominant symptom of osteoarthritis that causes patients to visit their family doctor. The pain experienced is intermittent, typically worst during and after weight-bearing activities. Inflammatory flares can happen during the course of the disease. Patients with osteoarthritis also experience stiffness: in the morning, after a period of inactivity, or particularly in the evening.

Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it always be so? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray. Don&rsquo;t frown. You have. And Beauty is a form of Genius &mdash; is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won&rsquo;t smile. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. People say sometimes that Beauty is only superficial. That may be so. But at least it is not so superficial as Thought is. To me, Beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah! realise your youth while you have it. Don&rsquo;t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A new Hedonism &mdash; that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last &mdash; such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty, becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!

The penal provisions encompass all those who perform genital mutilation, including health personnel. However, the girl or the woman involved (the victim) will not be liable to punishment, as it is not illegal to be circumcised. In 2004 the FGM law was strengthened with a duty to avert. By establishing a punishment of up to one year in prison or a fine, the duty to avert is meant to motivate professionals to act on their suspicions of an imminent FGM procedure. The law thereby provides additional pressure by instigating fear in the minds of the personnel if they do not try to avert FGM, thereby making them accountable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The background documents&nbsp;proposing the implementation of a duty to avert FGM make references to national security and its military secrets. In that context people can be punished if they are aware of dangers and do nothing to avert them. The duty to avert FGM seeks to predict a crime that has not yet taken place and to prevent it from happening. It is forward-looking and relies on a person&rsquo;s subjective guesses about an incident that may occur in the future. The duty to avert is activated whenever someone believes that it is more likely that a girl will be genitally mutilated than that she will not. This applies irrespective of the type of FGM and the scope of the operation. There is no requirement for positive evidence of a planned act of genital mutilation. The knowledge requirement for the duty to avert (&lsquo;more likely&rsquo;) indicates a higher threshold than the knowledge requirement for an existing duty to report child abuse (&lsquo;reason to believe&rsquo;, &lsquo;justified concern&rsquo;). As stated in the government&rsquo;s information circular, &lsquo;[t]he threshold for the duty to avert should, however, not be placed so high as to undermine the intention of the Act, which is to prevent FGM from taking place.&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">To satisfy the duty to avert, a report of concern should be given either to the Child Welfare Services or to the Police who would then examine the case. It is not recommended that professionals try to avert FGM by investigating and acting on their own accord; rather, they are advised to refer the case to the Child Welfare Services. It is not regarded a crime to be genitally mutilated if the procedure is done before moving to Norway. If a girl has younger sisters at risk of FGM, her case could be reported in order to prevent them from being mutilated, otherwise the duty of confidentiality will apply. If a girl suffers from health consequences due to FGM and is not given proper help and care by her parents, her case could be reported to the Child Welfare Services as child abuse. While the intention behind the duty to avert is commendable, it has introduced something new in the operation of the welfare services: threats of punishments for employees for not acting on their subjective guesses about the risk of a potential future crime. This law has not been openly discussed in the media or among experts, and was passed without much public discussion.</span></p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>The aim of the 2004 change to the FGM law was to</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Health practitioners were punishable for performing FGM before the 2004 law, so that B is incorrect.

To be noticed, health warnings need to stand out from the surrounding pack design and they need to be large enough to be read easily. To be persuasive, the warnings need to be understood, believed and judged to be personally relevant by the reader. It follows that having warnings about a broad range of the ill-effects of smoking increases the chance that people reading those warnings will find at least one ill-effect to which they relate. Finally, the effectiveness of any call to action is enhanced by specific instructions about the first step to take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that tobacco smoking is habitual and addictive, it was considered most improbable that smoking behaviour could easily be &quot;switched off&#39; by manipulations of package warnings or contents information. However, it is plausible that behavioural effects on smoking attributable to tobacco pack manipulations might be found among smokers contemplating quitting. Australian research suggests that approximately 9% of smokers are taking action to quit at any time, and over a year more than 40% make quit attempts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second and even more important group who could be influenced by manipulations of health warning information and contents labelling on packages are those people who are tempted to try smoking, are experimenting with it, or are contemplating taking it up. Early adolescence is the developmental stage at which most experimental smoking begins and later adolescence and early adulthood is when most of the shift to daily consumption takes place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research programme that resulted in the CBRC (1992) report was designed to show that the existing health warnings and product labelling requirements were inadequate, and to explore some alternatives that might increase their salience and potential effectiveness.

Like knights-errant setting forth from their domain in search of adventure, we were grounded in fealty to out sponsoring institutions and bounded by the oaths of our professional service. We hope that, like knights abroad, we would band together warmly in a foreign territory, our friendships tested and forged. But, in another way, we were more than just actors in a familiar cultural drama. Whether in remaking our institutional sponsorship, redefining our professional roles, or developing our team spirit, we were also narrators and directors, creating our roles and casting others as we wished in a production staged against the backdrop of Ana&rsquo;s imprisonment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There seem few human rights activists without sponsors. Activism is, in this sense, a representational activity. But not every potential institutional patrol is anxious to send would-be activists charging into battle. The scramble for the credentials of patronage and the processes by which institutions come to sponsor activists mean that action, even when guided by the activist&rsquo;s intuition or inspired by his faith, refers back to the institution&rsquo;s motive and forward to its goal. In this sense, the activist merely implements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Transforming Pat, Richard, and me from Writer in Washington, Doctor in New York, and Lawyer in Boston to writer-doctor-lawyer in Montevideo required imagination on the part of our sponsoring institutions, which initially regarded sending missions to Montevideo as somewhat outside their normal portfolio. Their long standing concern for the plight of foreign colleagues needed to be translated into an &lsquo;interest&rsquo; in four specific Uruguayan medical students and a willingness to send three activists on their trail. Our institutions were somewhat uncomfortable becoming involved in human rights work for several reasons. Scientific institutions often resist engaging in human rights work because they fear it would diminish their scientific neutrality &ndash; ironically the very neutrality which might enable and legitimise their human rights work. Often they resist this work because they fear they have little to offer &ndash; it seems counterintuitive, if not a little perverse, to think of political surveillance and imprisonment as threats to the confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship, of systematic torture as a deterioration in the public health system. Moreover, in my experience, scientists and professionals in institutions normally removed from politics sometimes seem to fear that they will appear na&iuml;ve and out of place in the hurly-burly of human rights work.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overcoming these doubts was not simply the triumph of action over the passive habits of professional fuddy-duddies, however attractive that image might be. These doubts were overcome primarily by relying on the well-worn norms of professional responsibility and human rights ideology. As a result, we moved to action by thinking about Ana and her compatriots as fellow professionals and objects for our moral outrage. My own employer, the Harvard Law School, has moved over the past few years toward a public commitment to &lsquo;international human rights&rsquo; which facilitated my own involvement in the Uruguayan mission considerably. This commitment is a bit difficult to explain, particularly given our widespread sense that any institutional participation in advocacy threatens the academic freedom, which gives the faculty faith in its prerogatives. In part, I suppose, foreign advocacy seems a neutral defence of the &lsquo;rule of law&rsquo; rather than a partisan choosing of sides. As a result, we tend, oddly enough, to use the rubric of &lsquo;human rights&rsquo; to refer to everything from foreign investment to cultural revolution. Partly, international human rights work seems to promise safety distanced contact with the certifiably barbaric. Partly, this work seems the modern extension of an institutional commitment to civil rights responsibility.</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>How does the author differentiate the quest of human rights activists from those of actors in childhood fantasies and cultural dramas?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>In the first paragraph, the author draws similarities between&nbsp;activists and actors in childhood fantasies.

Pain, in that age, she argues, became less about spiritual purification and began to be seen in adversarial terms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;In those circumstances, pain is not something that you accept passively or submit to, or even actually embrace,&rsquo; says Bourke. &lsquo;Pain becomes something very different; it becomes something you have to fight. You don the armour and fight with all your might.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the mid 19th century, physicians began to acknowledge pain as an evolutionary mechanism. It was a sign that something was wrong in the body. Diagnosis suddenly involved asking questions of the patient about their suffering and trying to get them to personally pinpoint the areas of their body experiencing discomfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That sense of the necessity of a patient&rsquo;s involvement in diagnosis was short lived, however. Chemical and neurological testing in the 20th century once again revolutionised the diagnostic technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The language of pain then became less important, argues Bourke: &lsquo;What was important for the doctor was simply to get the tests done and they were the tests that showed what was wrong with the person. As opposed to stories of pain; as opposed to hearing the patient tell the story of her suffering.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all feel pain. Yet in society as a whole, pain is not a sensation that many of us like to discuss. Writers can venture forth freely about love, but pain is not a subject for polite discussion, and unless it&rsquo;s bound in ropes and leather, it&rsquo;s rarely a subject of literary interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the novelist Virginia Woolf once wrote: &#39;To hinder the description of illness in literature, there is the poverty of the language. English, which can express the thoughts of Hamlet and the tragedy of Lear, has no words for the shiver and the headache. It has all grown one way. The merest schoolgirl, when she falls in love, has Shakespeare or Keats to speak her mind for her; but let a sufferer try to describe a pain in his head to a doctor and language at once runs dry.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to talk about any powerful sensation,&rsquo; says Bourke, suggesting that our reluctance to discuss pain is in part an unwillingness to cause further discomfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Pain is particularly difficult. Talking about pain does have a risk of inflicting pain,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;A lot of people who suffer extreme pain, even chronic pain, tell me that in talking about it to their friends and loved ones, they actually end up inflicting pain on those loved ones. So they prefer to remain silent.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In researching the history of pain over the past 300 years, Bourke says what perhaps struck her most was the willingness of many in the medical profession to diminish the suffering of people based on sex and race. Many doctors, she suggests, continued to believe until relatively recently that certain groups within society had diminished capacity for pain; in some cases, that they were incapable of feeling suffering at all.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;There were all these arguments that African Americans, that ethnic minorities, that native Australians did not truly feel pain. Of course this is very convenient because it enabled others to treat these people in really appalling ways, but these arguments were really deeply entrenched within British, American, Australian and New Zealand society. Of course they were arguments that meant that you didn&rsquo;t need to treat certain peoples with respect and you also didn&rsquo;t need to give them sufficient analgesics.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;One of the really shocking things I discovered was that well into the 20th century, African Americans in American hospitals were not given anaesthetics even when they had major operations&mdash;limb amputations, for example&mdash;on the understanding, on the belief, that they didn&rsquo;t truly suffer.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;I think one of the other really interesting things is that if a minority group or a woman&mdash;because women were also one of these categories&mdash;complained of pain, then they were simply being &ldquo;hysterical&rdquo; and therefore they didn&rsquo;t need to be given analgesics or anaesthetics. If they did not complain, then they were simply insensitive to pain and therefore they didn&rsquo;t need to be given analgesics or anaesthetics either.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;So it really was a catch-22 situation for these groups.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From &quot;The History of Pain&quot;, Antony Funnell, 22 July, 2014&nbsp;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/sundayextra/the-history-of-pain/5614136</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":100},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>According to Joanna Bourke, which of the following statements is true about pain prior to 1800?</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:upper-roman;\">\r\n\t<li>Pain was thought of as correctional punishment.</li>\r\n\t<li>Pain was seen in adversarial terms.</li>\r\n\t<li>Pain was acknowledged as an evolutionary mechanism.</li>\r\n\t<li>Those in the medical profession were willing to diminish the suffering of people based on their sex and race.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n","explanation":"<p>At the beginning of the passage, Bourke distinguishes between 19<sup>th</sup> century (1800-1900) society, which viewed pain as something &ldquo;to be seen in adversarial terms&rdquo; (that is, something to combat), and before then, where pain was more about &ldquo;spiritual purification.&rdquo; The second sentence states that pain, &ldquo;in that age&rdquo; (the 19<sup>th</sup> century) &ldquo;began to be seen in adversarial terms.

Immunoglobulins, or antibodies, are the major immunological proteins of the adaptive immune response. When the body is first exposed to a foreign antigen, it mounts a primary immune response. IgM is the first class of antibody produced by activated B-cells and mediates the initial component of this primary response. It circulates in the blood as a pentamer (5 units joined together). During this response, B-cells undergo a process called class-switching, in which they change the type of antibody they produce and the specificity of the antibodies&nbsp;for the antigen increases. Each B-cell undergoes class-switching once only.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the adaptive immune system has cleared the infection, a small population of class-switched plasma cells remain and provide what is known as immunological memory. These cells are able to respond quickly to a second exposure to the same antigen, producing a greater amount of specific antibodies in a shorter period of time. IgG is the major antibody of the secondary immune response and is the only type that can cross the placenta as it is monomeric. IgA is found in its monomeric form in blood and its dimeric form in secretions. It&nbsp;is primarily responsible for mucosal immunity and&nbsp;is secreted in milk with IgG.

All reactions require an initial input of energy to destabilise the reactants and break their existing chemical bonds. This energy is referred to as activation energy (E<sub>A</sub>) and the amount of E<sub>A</sub> required to overcome this kinetic barrier determines the speed of the reaction. Once in the transitional state, the atoms of the reactants will form new, more stable bonds to form the final product(s). The difference in free energy (&Delta;G) between the reactants and products determines whether a reaction can occur spontaneously or not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While exergonic reactions are theoretically spontaneous in living cells, in reality the amount of E<sub>A</sub> required to initiate reactions is large enough to prevent most from happening unassisted. Enzymes catalyse reactions by lowering the E<sub>A</sub>&nbsp;required for reactants to reach a transitional state; they do not remove the requirement for E<sub>A</sub>&nbsp;and they can only speed up reactions that would happen eventually anyway. The enzyme-substrate reaction is in an equilibrium situation: if product builds up, the reaction slows.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each enzyme has an optimal temperature and pH range for maximal functioning. Inhibitors reduce or prevent enzyme function: a competitive inhibitor binds to the active (catalytic) site while a non-competitive inhibitor binds to a different site on the enzyme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cells depend on ATP (energy) to function. Ingested organic molecules are processed through metabolic pathways within cells to harvest the chemical energy stored in bonds of those molecules to generate ATP. These pathways depend on enzymes to lower the E<sub>A</sub> of the intermediary reactions so that they occur under physiological conditions. Endergonic reactions are coupled to exergonic reactions which generate enough&nbsp;&Delta;G to overcome the unfavourable E<sub>A</sub> of the endergonic reactions. Uncoupled exergonic reactions release free energy as heat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many metabolic pathways, the first enzyme is often the major control enzyme = rate-limiting.

Within a pair of enantiomers, the amount of dextrorotation from one enantiomer is equal to the amount of levorotation in the other.

The total concentration of tryptophan (D or L) is therefore 2 mM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In regards to observed rotation, for every 1 D-tryptophan there are 3 L tryptophan in the mixed solution.

This gives L-tryptophan an effective concentration of 2/3 of 1.5 mM = 1 mM. This can then be substituted in to the equation provided for observed rotation. Rearranging that equation yields observed rotation=(specific rotation)x(concentration)x(path length)=(31.5)(0.001)(0.2)=0.0063 degrees.

I admired the lovely pattern on its wings, and&nbsp;then wrapped it in one of the rags I was washing and&nbsp;hid it away beneath the foundation of&nbsp;the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hadn&#39;t thought about this moth since then; but the moment it came to mind I got on my&nbsp;knees and looked under the house until I found it. So many things in my life had changed&nbsp;even the way I looked; but when I unwrapped the moth from its funeral shroud, it was the&nbsp;same startlingly lovely creature as on the day I had entombed it. It seemed to be wearing a&nbsp;robe in subdued grays and browns, like Mother wore when she went to her mah-jongg&nbsp;games at night. Everything about it seemed beautiful and perfect, and so utterly unchanged.&nbsp;If only one thing in my life had been the same as during that first week in Kyoto ... As I&nbsp;thought of this my mind began to swirl like a hurricane. It struck me that we-that moth and I were&nbsp;two opposite extremes. My existence was as unstable as a stream, changing in every&nbsp;way; but the moth was like a piece of stone, changing not at all. While thinking this thought, I&nbsp;reached out a finger to feel the moth&#39;s velvety surface; but when I brushed it with my&nbsp;fingertip, it turned all at once into a pile of ash without even a sound, without even a moment&nbsp;in which I could see it crumbling. I was so astonished I let out a cry.&nbsp;The swirling in my mind&nbsp;stopped; I felt as if I had stepped into the eye of a storm. I let the tiny shroud and its pile of&nbsp;ashes flutter to the ground; and now I understood the thing that had puzzled me all morning.&nbsp;The stale air had washed away. The past was gone. My mother and father were dead and I&nbsp;could do nothing to change it. But I suppose that for the past year I&#39;d been dead in a way too.&nbsp;And my sister . . . yes, she was gone; but I wasn&#39;t gone. I&#39;m not sure this will make sense to&nbsp;you, but I felt as though I&#39;d turned around to look in a different direction, so that I no longer&nbsp;faced backward toward the past, but forward toward the future. And now the question&nbsp;confronting me was this: What would that future be?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The moment this question formed in my mind, I knew with as much certainty as I&#39;d ever&nbsp;known anything that sometime during that day I would receive a sign. This was why the&nbsp;bearded man had opened the window in my dream. He was saying to me, &quot;Watch for the&nbsp;thing that will show itself to you. Because that thing, when you find it, will be your future.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no time for another thought before Auntie called out to me:&nbsp;&quot;Chiyo, come here!&quot;</p>\r\n","tag":"HUM02 Fiction","published":true,"difficulty":1},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>Which aspect of the moth is central to the protagonist&rsquo;s insight?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The moth&rsquo;s death and beauty are considered quite thoughtfully by the protagonist, and therefore represent possible answers. However, the passage is really discussing how much the protagonist&rsquo;s life is unstable. This is contrasted to the way the moth remained completely unchanged since the day it had died. In addition, the loss of this constancy when the moth vanishes is the point at which the protagonist breaks, and considers at once that her past has vanished.

Therefore C is the best answer, and makes sense given that the poem is all about the landscape. There is no discussion of the poet experiencing a physical injury (A). The reference to &quot;strange and awful hour&quot; is a clue that the poet is talking about a particular, special moment, rather than something that occurs every day, so B is incorrect.

Some older adults with DM are frail and have other underlying chronic conditions, substantial DM-related comorbidity, or limited physical or cognitive functioning, but other older persons with DM have little comorbidity and are active.

For many patients, particularly those who are clinically complex, referral to a DM educator for one-on-one counseling or group classes, a comprehensive DM management program, or specialty physician care may improve control.&nbsp;Diabetes mellitus education programs may be particularly important when addressing the needs of persons with DM from minority and immigrant communities. There are many well-established DM curricula that are appropriate for the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse populations. An additional element of DM education and self-management training that is important for the frail or cognitively impaired older patient, persons with limited English proficiency, and racial and ethnic minorities is the involvement and education of family members or caregivers. Patients and, in some cases, family members and caregivers should have their knowledge and information needs assessed and have educational efforts tailored to these needs. Finally, it is important to note that regular reassessment of treatment goals and management skills is integral to DM education and that reinforcement may be necessary to make and sustain behavior change. This is particularly true for older adults, whose functional and cognitive status may change over short periods of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For older persons, whose life expectancy may be shorter than the time needed to benefit from an intervention, a key clinical issue is the expected time horizon for benefit from specific interventions. Clinical trials have demonstrated that approximately 8 years are needed before the benefits of glycemic control are reflected in a reduction in microvascular complications such as diabetic retinopathy or renal disease and that only 2 to 3 years are required to see benefits from better control of blood pressure and lipids. For this reason, this guideline places special emphasis on domains particularly important to the reduction of macrovascular endpoints for persons with DM&mdash;blood pressure management, aspirin therapy, and lipid management&mdash;for which data from RCTs and systematic reviews provide strong evidence in favor of intensive treatment. It is likely that there is an association between moderate glycemic control and enhancement of wound healing, reduction of symptoms associated with hyperglycemia such as polyuria and fatigue, and possibly maximization of cognitive function. However, the available data suggest that many of these shorter-term benefits may be achieved with less-aggressive glycemic targets than those recommended in most of the national DM guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Quality of life is another important consideration in caring for older adults with DM. Although several interventions have been found to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality, it is clear that the potential benefits may be associated with reduced quality of life in older adults, particularly for those with chronic conditions. Specifically, complicated, costly, or uncomfortable treatment regimens may result in deleterious side effects, reduction in adherence to recommended therapies, and a decrement in overall well-being. The possible effects on quality of life should be taken into account in any treatment plan.</span></p>\r\n","tag":"HUM04 Non-fiction medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>What is the major point of difference between treating diabetes mellitus in older and younger patients?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The first paragraph provides that &lsquo;the care of older adults with DM is complicated by their clinical and functional heterogeneity&rsquo;.

It is important to realize that the gastric mucosa is not impervious to damage by these agents. The use of the term gastric mucosal barrier has often been misconstrued to suggest that this tissue is impenetrable. It was coined by Charles Code (36) to explain the relatively small amount of hydrochloric acid that &ldquo;back-diffuses&rdquo; into the mucosa. In fact, mucosal injury occurs regularly, but does not lead to clinically significant disruption of the function or even the &ldquo;barrier&rdquo; properties of the tissue. The reasons for this include the fact that there are several &ldquo;layers&rdquo; to mucosal defense, with secondary components becoming more important when more superficial components are breached, and because of a very rapid process of repair when damage to the epithelium occurs (191). Moreover, the various components of mucosal defense can be modulated by a number of endogenous substances, including prostaglandins. The net result is that the systemic circulation is protected from invasion by microbes, microbial products, and other toxins. On the other hand, there are certain circumstances in which mucosal defense is impaired, such as after administration of NSAIDs, thereby rendering the mucosa more susceptible to injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As alluded to above, mucosal defense is a dynamic process. In a healthy organism, the resistance of the gastric mucosa to injury is enhanced when irritants are present in the stomach, such as through an augmentation of mucosal blood flow and an efflux of mucus from surface epithelial cells. There are some conditions in which there is an impairment of these adaptive responses, rendering the gastric mucosa more susceptible to injury induced by luminal irritants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The various levels of mucosal defense can be viewed in a structural sense, starting at the lumen and moving into deeper levels of the tissue.

The capacity to express disagreement with policies and social institutions is vital not only for keeping a check on power, but also for encouraging democratic reform and social equity. Emerging discontent, when expressed through organized social movements, has an effect on those in power and can lead to positive social and legal changes: &quot;Presidents, when pushed by social movements, may enforce good laws. Judges, observing a changing temper in the society, may come forth with humane decisions.&quot; For those without direct access to political and economic power, protest is one of the few ways by which they can attempt to influence government. Protests show that there are large numbers of people who support a particular position and are willing to take to the streets in order to achieve their demands. Thus political protest-including workplace actions, mass mobilizations of people, and civil disobedience-is a key method for participating in the democratic process. From the abolition of slavery and the establishment of social welfare programs, to the creation of protections for trade unions and the dismantling of legislated segregation in the American South, pressure from below has often led to positive social change. The importance of protecting public space for political participation is reflected by the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly enshrined in the <em>Canadian Charterof Rights and Freedoms.&#39; </em>Indeed, the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized that political expression is at the very heart of freedom of expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, where political movements pose a challenge to the distribution of political and economic power, social movements can test the &quot;innermost integrity of the government, as well as the limits of its boundaries.&quot; A state&#39;s response to such a challenge is a measure of its commitment to democratic principles, for the state possesses powerful tools with which to suppress dissent. It is important to remember that, while many of the movements mentioned above are now lauded for their role in creating a more just and equitable world, they were more commonly viewed as chaotic and criminal at the time that their struggles were waged. Today, a wave of protest activity in Canada has focused largely on the global justice movement. As in the past, protesters are more often met by police than by government representatives willing to hear their views. Indeed, there appears to be an inherent conflict between the right of protesters to publicly support a cause through demonstrations and the role of the police in maintaining public order.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n","tag":"HUM05 Non-fiction non-medical","published":true,"difficulty":50},"child_mcqs":[{"description":"<p>Why is &#39;a state&#39;s response to [social movements] a measure of its commitment to democratic principles&#39;?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>The preceding sentence provides that social movements test the innermost integrity of government, as they challenge the distribution of political and economic power.

A reproductive isolating mechanism is any behavioral, structural, or biochemical trait that prevents individuals of different species from reproducing successfully together. Some result from traits belonging to the species themselves, while others result from environmental factors. There exists a wide range of prezygotic mechanisms that prevent fertilization, thereby maintaining species isolation. Three such mechanisms prevent mating. Species that occupy separate habitats do not encounter one another to reproduce, which is ecological isolation. Otherwise compatible species that inhabit an overlapping range can remain in temporal isolation because their reproductive cycles for flowering or mating occur at different times. A mating ritual by one species may prevent members of another species from recognizing or selecting a mate, which is called behavioural isolation. Two prezygotic mechanisms restrict fertilization.

The amino acids can broadly be classed as acidic (average pK<sub>a</sub> = 4), basic (average pK<sub>a</sub> = 11), polar, and non-polar. The wide variety of possible protein structures allow them to serve many different roles in biological systems. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an example of a protein that serves as an enzyme. LDH catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate and, simultaneously, the conversion of NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup>. It is comprised of four subunits. Two varieties of subunits exist (M and H), which differ slightly in amino acid composition, but have identical catalytic activity. The exact combination of subunits that makes up the LDH differs between tissues. These different combinations are termed isotypes, labelled 1 through 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LDH is normally found in low levels within the serum. Damage to tissues releases the LDH normally contained and can drastically increase the serum levels. Elevated LDH activity is therefore a marker of issue damage and the specific isotype allows for the damaged tissue to be identified.

What is the maximum amount of Nylon-6,6 that can be produced by this reaction?</p>\r\n","explanation":"<p>Though equal masses of adipic acid (AA) and hexamethylene diamine (HD) are in each solution, the solutions do not contain an equal number of moles of the two species. Calculating the number of moles for each species first requires finding the molar mass of each species, which is approximately 116 for HD and 146 for AA. This information and the masses of HD and AA question can be substituted into the equation moles = mass/molar mass. This will reveal that there is about 1/40 or 0.025 mol of HD and 1/50 or 0.02 mol of AA in the beaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the two compounds react on a 1:1 basis, the reaction will terminate once AA has been exhausted. This means that 0.02 mol of Nylon-6,6 subunits will be produced. The next step is to determine what the mass of each subunit is. Adding the molar masses of HD and AA means that the polymer subunit could have a maximum potential molar mass of 262 g/mol. It is important to consider as well, how the subunits are joining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subunits are linked by amide bonds, produced by the reaction between an amine and carboxylic acid. It is important to recognise that water would be evolved from such a reaction. This can be arrived at by comparing the atoms in the functional groups mentioned. Since water is lost for every amide bond, two water molecules are lost for each subunit (one to hold it together and another to attach it to the preceding subunit). This means that the subunits have an average molar mass of 228 g/mol. Knowing the molar mass of the subunit and the number of moles, the total mass of the Nylon-6,6 can be calculated by 228*0.02 = 4.56 g.</p>\r\n","rating":0.0,"answers":[{"description":"<p>6.00 g</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>5.24 g</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>4.88 g</p>\r\n","correct":false},{"description":"<p>4.56 g</p>\r\n","correct":true}]},{"description":"<p>Nylon-6,6 is more heat resistant than other nylons, but will melt and eventually combust with increasing heat.

This is very straight forward, but only if the correct structure of the subunit was found in Question 1. One Nylon-6,6 subunit will produce 12 CO<sub>2</sub>, 2 NO and 11 H<sub>2</sub>O. These products contain a total of 37 oxygen atoms. Two oxygen atoms are supplied by the subunit itself, so only 35 additional oxygen atoms need to be supplied. Thus, each mole of Nylon-6,6 subunit will require 35 moles of oxygen atoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step is to calculate the number of moles of Nylon-6,6 subunit, which can be calculated using the formula moles = mass/molar mass. moles = 11.4/228 = 0.05. The number of moles of oxygen atoms must then be 0.05*35 = 1.75 mol.
