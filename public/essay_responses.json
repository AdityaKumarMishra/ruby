ourselves. Law and order forms the cornerstone of a cohesive society, one that is comprised of so many differences in race, ideals and culture. When these systems that govern us elicit the human lust for power over his fellow man, and when they are allowed to bed for the purposes of a few; our race as a whole is doomed to our own violent instincts. We destroy each other. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nPower corrupts all of man. Dictatorships are born always from a hunger for power. Idi Amin's reign in Uganda in the 1970's saw him take control of the entire country; he had power over their actions, their thoughts, their very beliefs. My family fled his reign but there were many who died in his quest for power. He bent the law to his will; killing thousands of innocent civilians who dared oppose him. His dictatorship is a perfect example of the law being used for an ominous purpose; not to enforce society's order, to enforce an order of his own. In the wake of such injustice violence can be the only result. Those that enforce the twisted laws hunger for power of their own, and man's cruel nature is revealed. Having no consequence for actions that are normally decreed reprehensible leads to the abundance of such actions. We are violent creatures, and when laws no longer dictate our desires the darkest human characteristic of violence against our fellow man is allowed to flourish. In doing so, our structured order falls to pieces, and chaos reigns. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf equality of the law is maintained then it does prevent such desires from taking hold for the most part. These laws differ greatly around the world and yet they all produce the same desirable order that we as a populous need, to prevent ourselves from ending our own future. Yet even today, laws tailored to the minorities of society lead to the manifestation of this very conflict. The shootings of unarmed African-Americans such as teenager Trayvon Martin in recent years has seen the confidence of society in the laws that govern us fall apart. Police officers are now being targeted, weekly riots rage across the USA and anarchy ensues. The issue isn't with the laws themselves, it lies with those who enforece them. if the enforcers of the law are not held to be accountable by the very same constitutions, why should any of us be? When these laws fall apart we as a race are nothing more than primitive. we are allowed to feed our never-ending desires for power and violence to no tangible end. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf laws are continually contradicted by those in power, our society will eventually destroy itself. Law is what sets us apart as a race from our less-evolved ancestors.If we allow the law to fall by the wayside as our human desires dominate our actions, we will reach a veritable extinction as a functioning society, and will find ourselves living among the very animals we thought we'd left behind; that's if we don't all kill each other first. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTime: 35:57\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n- Struggled with this topic, tried to keep asking myself \"So what?\", yet found it hard to convey any clear thoughts.

As a race we are violent creatures; it’s an inpulse that we feel deeply at our core, and as much as we can suppress this dangerous trait, there will always be violence between us as people; over ideals that can define entire nations and lifetimes and sometimes over even the most insignificant of disagreements.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n .\u003cbr\u003e\r\nSince the beginning of the modern age violence has defined the past and shaped the future of our race. Hundreds of millions of people died as a result of two world encompassing wars, murder and violent assaults including domestic incidents happen in their millions each year, and even culturally; we are all fed on. Movies, television, even sport in the form of the fast rising UFC, all act as representations of the human race’s collective infatuation with violence.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe all know that violence is wrong, the authors of the quotes support that. We are constantly reminded in school and on the same TVs that show violence that we should never hit, never retaliate with force- and yet there will always be bullies, drunkards and abusive parents who will propagate these cycles of violence.\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAs noble as it may be to suggest we can live in a world without violence, the fact is we need it. Ideals founded in violence do not respond to anything else. We have seen this in history with the Nazis, Pol Pott, Idi Amin and any other dictators. Even this year ISIS now pose a threat that cannot simply be negotiated with. When violence comes out as a human trait all that can stop it is more violence.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThat concept may seem unacceptable; “Violence is never the answer”, “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind”. They are optimistic thoughts. The truth is, humans are and always have been a violent race. It is simply our nature. As much as we’d like to think that we can be noble and stand with solidarity against it, the fact remains; sometimes to stop violence, all that is left to do is fight back. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","user_id":191,"created_at":"2016-07-27T04:31:02.204Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:58.532Z","essay_id":6,"slug":"apatel-essay-1-46890","activation_date":"2016-07-27","expiry_date":"2016-09-27","time_submited":"2016-08-05T06:21:13.882Z","elapsed_time":1241261,"status":"has_feedback","course_id":44},{"id":402,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo one is one-hundred percent sure of who they are. We all have doubts about ourselves, small anxieties that plague our thoughts constantly. Some people hide them well, others don't, but we all have them. Our inner thoughts dictate our lives. They can motivate us to our highest accomplishments, and bring us screaming back down to the lowest depths of our lives just as easily. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nMy father is an extremely gifted man. He is renowned for his intellect; he's an accomplished engineer, bilingual and extremely knowledgeable about a multitude of topics.He could never manage to rid himself of his self doubts however. He married my mother, a very successful woman, had two children of which I was one and lived happily for a time. A time that lasted until he allowed his fears and doubts that only occupied his imagination to become reality. He couldn't find work, so he gave up trying. He tried to write a book, but gave up after the first chapter. The fear of failure had become all encompassing, and ironically brought about the exact thing he feared. Faced with our lowest moments we can take two paths; try to regain control and fight our way past our own doubts, or succumb to them, and allow ourselves to continue to be dictated by them. My father chose the latter. After his divorce twelve years ago, moving back in with his parents (in Uganda no less), forsaking contact with his children, living a life alone, he tried to outrun his failures. You can't outrun your own thoughts, they form you.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nHis failures motivate me. My greatest fear in life is that I will succumb to failure the same way that my father did. That terrifies me. I know I have these thoughts constantly, and I face them head on as much as I can. I throw myself into my work, I constantly bite off more than I can chew and I berate myself for ever lacking discipline or even showing the slightest hint of a characteristic I would attribute to my father. Is it sad that this motivates me so? Maybe, but I will be the one who suffers the consequences of allowing my fears and doubts to take hold. I will not allow myself to fall into the entrapment of my negative thoughts. This drives me to be a better person in all aspects of my life. For that, I do have my father to thank. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe all have different driving forces that dictate who we are. Our thoughts are moulded by our experiences more than anything else; what we've done, what we've seen, what we choose to listen to and take in. To be happy we have to be content with these thoughts. We have to be able to acknowledge our fears and doubts so that we can strive to diminish them. They will always be there, and we need them to help motivate us, as they motivate me, but if we allow these fears and doubts to become ubiquitous, soon enough they will drive us to become all that we are fearful of being.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","user_id":191,"created_at":"2016-07-27T04:31:02.223Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:56.689Z","essay_id":7,"slug":"apatel-essay-2-93071","activation_date":"2016-07-27","expiry_date":"2016-10-14","time_submited":"2016-08-10T02:09:03.539Z","elapsed_time":117679,"status":"marked","course_id":44},{"id":406,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":191,"created_at":"2016-07-27T04:31:02.271Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:56.722Z","essay_id":12,"slug":"apatel-essay-6-63878","activation_date":"2016-07-27","expiry_date":"2016-12-21","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":44},{"id":407,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":191,"created_at":"2016-07-27T04:31:02.282Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:56.730Z","essay_id":13,"slug":"apatel-essay-7-74499","activation_date":"2016-07-27","expiry_date":"2017-01-07","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":44},{"id":408,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":191,"created_at":"2016-07-27T04:31:02.292Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:56.738Z","essay_id":14,"slug":"apatel-essay-8-60047","activation_date":"2016-07-27","expiry_date":"2017-01-24","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":44},{"id":409,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":191,"created_at":"2016-07-27T04:31:02.305Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:56.745Z","essay_id":15,"slug":"apatel-essay-9-88421","activation_date":"2016-07-27","expiry_date":"2017-02-10","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":44},{"id":410,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":191,"created_at":"2016-07-27T04:31:02.315Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:56.753Z","essay_id":16,"slug":"apatel-essay-10-50733","activation_date":"2016-07-27","expiry_date":"2017-02-27","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":44},{"id":404,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\r\n“What do you want to be when you grow up?” It’s a question we’ve all been asked before. Did you become what you answered? Highly doubtful. We are constantly told to follow our passion, yet so few of us do. Most fabricate excuses from their lives, and end up not only resenting themselves, but those closest to them.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nSteve Jobs believed that when someone worked on a vision that they truly believed in, they would never see it as work. “The vision pulls you in”. Ask anyone what they really, deep down desire to pursue as a career and the chances are they won’t say whatever field they’re currently in (or they'll lie). We’re afraid to follow our passions. What if I fail? What will people think of me? Yet it’s these people that reach old age in good health and suddenly, into their heads arrives the most terrifying of thoughts: “what if?” What if I had pursued my one true passion? What would’ve happened if I gave up school and tried to start that business? What if I hadn’t decided to give up playing my favourite sport? The moment these people realise how precious their time on earth is, ironically is when most have the epiphany they haven’t used it well enough. Dying with regret is no way to die.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nLarry Smith, an economics professor at the University of Waterloo gave a Ted talk in recent years on the topic “why you will fail to have a great career”. He cited the excuses that we all give for not pursuing our passions: “I’d rather be a nice, normal person than a crazed genius”. “I want to be a great friend, a great son, a great spouse, that’s more important to me than a great career”. My mother used to always say “imagine if I hadn’t had you kids, what I’d be achieving right now”. It was always a joke made in gest, and yet only after listening to Mr. Smith did I realise the joke for what it was: an excuse. Since my sister and I moved out my mother has achieved extraordinary things; she currently runs the ambulance service of Doha, Qatar. She’s lucky. She got away with it. Most don’t. When we devote our lives to passions that we truly believe in, time and all else become inconsequential. If all people forgave their passions for the excuse of having children or being a good partner, our world would simply never advance. Passion is what drives us as a race to achieve things that were once never possible, with all else being inconsequential.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nEveryone can achieve great things. Most don’t. If you ever have the thought “If only I had…” It will break your spirit. You’ll live out your days seeing your family, your friends, your workmates, as nothing more than your jailors. You’ll live with a resentment that you’ll never allow yourself to be rid of, because deep down you know that you are truly the one to blame. So go out, and follow your passion, and with some luck, that regret will never find you. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n32 mins :42 seconds\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n- Hi Jack, sorry it's been a while. Took a long time to figure out how to approach this topic and still feel as if I was babbling on without direction.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","user_id":191,"created_at":"2016-07-27T04:31:02.249Z","updated_at":"2016-10-08T03:06:28.057Z","essay_id":10,"slug":"apatel-essay-4-79679","activation_date":"2016-07-27","expiry_date":"2016-11-17","time_submited":"2016-10-07T05:35:36.051Z","elapsed_time":2395896,"status":"marked","course_id":44},{"id":405,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003cp\u003eFame is an incredibly powerful concept. It has the potential to change those who are awarded it, as well as those that idolise such figures. In our modern age of accessibility to the world, fame is something that is becoming easier to obtain, and although it may be destructive in some cases in the past, when its used as a platform to spread messages of unity and peace; it can be significantly valuable.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe ubiquitousness of smartphones has allowed people to garner fame for different issues and political movements around the world. Two such prominent instances occurred only this year. The Turkish military’s attempted coup saw soldiers take to the streets and initiate hostilities with civilians. Turkish President Recep Erdogan began a call to arms for his citizens over facetime from his iphone. Civilians stormed the streets, overthrowing the military successfully and reclaiming their cities. Erdogan used his fame to make the crisis at hand at once famous to his people- initiating an unprecedented, united defense of their homes. Along similar lines, In the USA this year following the numerous police shootings of African Americans, normal citizens and celebrities alike made the black lives matter movement famous around the world. Social media again at the forefront. Suddenly a movement that had started from humble beginnings in one country was known to the majority of the world, and added to. These two instances show that in the technologically driven world that we live in, fame can be used as a tool to create change, inspire people, and instill action.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nWith this power of social media, figures of inspiration have earned fame to a level that would not be possible otherwise. Importantly, they have used this fame as a platform to reach people around the world to instill change for the better. Malala Yousafzai, the young woman who was shot by the Taliban simply for being a female at school, is the perfect exemplar. She is now the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, and serves as a source of inspiration for women worldwide. Muslim friends of mine idolise her, and often talk about the remarkable fight she has put up for her ideals. Them, like millions of others, follow her on social platforms such as Instagram, facebook and twitter. She uses her fame to give hope to millions of people around the world. This is an exemplary instance of the power of modern fame- and most significantly; Malala (going by her Instagram posts) doesn’t see herself as different to any of her followers. Anyone who instills such hope in their peers can become famous in our hyper-connected society, for the betterment of it.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFame over the years has been deemed dangerous and deceptively desirable, as the numerous quotes attest. However as fame becomes easier to achieve for people and even ideals in our global community, its power to bring good can truly be harnessed. Creating change, beginning significant far-reaching movements, making the world a better place: they are all made more possible through the power of modern day fame. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTime:

Fiction?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nHistory can be defined as the study of past events, as a modern society in a technologically advance world, we as individuals have vast access to the past and present and are able to make our own judgements on historical events. However, is this information we are reading correct? Is everything in our past considered great? This response will argue that history is a mere interpretation of facts by individuals, and that while great men do make history. It is the evil deranged men that make a more significant impact on modern day history.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nThroughout history, society has been plagued by unfortunate events that have shaped and changed the world. It is these events that deny Thomas Carlyle’s motion that “The History of the world is but the biography of great men” Looking back throughout history the effects of significant historical events are still prevalent and shape society today. For example Nazi Germany. One of the world’s most horrific events with millions of Jews and others not deemed worthy of survival killed at the hands of dictator Adolf Hitler. This event stands out in History created and shaped buy one of the world’s evillest men. This shows how not only great men create history.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen reflecting upon such events as Natzi Germany and wars throughout history and how they are perceived by society, it can be argued that interpretation of events is a significant contributor to how these events are perceived by society. For example, the Vietnam War. Australians view the war significantly differently to Asian countries, this difference can be attributed to how differing countries have interpreted history with both sides believing that they were doing the right thing throughout the war. Further there is often no set facts or visual evidence throughout our past, this leaves significant room for interpretation. Additionally, Historians are not machines they are individuals with emotions, so there can be no guarantee that due to their own past they can interpret facts in a completely objective manner.  Thus showing how history is a mere interpretation of facts.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt is important to note that great men in history do need to be acknowledged, as without these men, we as a society could not be where we are today. Take Albert Einstein and his laws of relativity and Thomas Edison’s invention of the light bulb, or Captain Cook the great explorer. These men have all significantly shaped and created the worlds history. However it is the shocking past events and the interpretation of these events that are forever burned into our history to guarantee that history is also created by significantly evil and deranged individuals.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nOverall it can be seen that individual’s interpretation of events over time help to write history, and not all these events have been created and shaped by great men. Rather some of the world’s most significant events have been shaped by the world’s most evil spawn. This further reinforces the history of the world is not only a biography of great men. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-08-02T10:33:18.954Z","updated_at":"2016-10-02T03:45:27.456Z","essay_id":15,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-96473","activation_date":"2016-08-02","expiry_date":"2016-10-02","time_submited":"2016-09-29T06:42:56.854Z","elapsed_time":14510,"status":"marked","course_id":134},{"id":33,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:46:15.297Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:53.672Z","essay_id":11,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-83766","activation_date":"2016-06-23","expiry_date":"2016-09-07","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":36,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:46:15.327Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:53.696Z","essay_id":13,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-72086","activation_date":"2016-06-23","expiry_date":"2016-12-09","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":37,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:46:15.357Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:53.705Z","essay_id":6,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-97991","activation_date":"2016-06-23","expiry_date":"2017-01-09","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":38,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:46:15.366Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:53.713Z","essay_id":7,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-40088","activation_date":"2016-06-23","expiry_date":"2017-02-09","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":34,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe greatest risk \u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nWith great risk comes great success, and behind every great there is great failure. Risk is an everyday part of the human life. Without risk and failures one cannot grow as an individual to reach our full potential. As it is the failures and consequences of risk that broaden our knowledge base, provoke and stimulate learning and change us as individuals in a positive manner. Without mistakes humans cannot simply learn. This response will argue that those who risk the most will reap the largest rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn any situation individuals are faced with two choices: 1) tackle the situation head on, take a risk and put ourselves outside our comfort zone or 2) we can approach the situation in a way we feel comfortable, not push ourselves and avoid the prospect of failure. It is when an individual chooses option 1 to take a risk does he experience personal growth and success. An example of this is James Dyson, the billionaire engineer behind the now ubiquitous Dyson vacuum cleaner. James dedicated six years of his life taking extreme risk as he believed he could revolutionise the vacuum cleaner world. He created over 5000 prototypes experiencing failure after failure. Each time learning from his mistakes in the hope to get his system to work. Before everything was pieced together he plunged deeper and deeper into debt. His debt totalling $4 million and his house mortgaged three times, his friends and family begged him to stop. This highlights how risk does not come without consequence, had he been unsuccessful he would have lost literally everything. However as he chose to learn from each failed prototype, and to turn failure into motivation he successfully created  the world’s most innovative and popular vacuum. Dyson put himself outside his comfort zone, he was willing to learn from his failures and he reaped huge success. This further shows how those that risk the most reap the largest rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nAs previously explained every risk comes with consequence and failure, to grow as a society and as an individual we need to be willing to take these risks. As without failure how can one learn from their mistakes? And improve upon themselves as an individual? It is the instinctive human fear of failing that stops us from experiencing all life has to offer. However, this notion should not solely be taken as a negative. As within society not every individual can be an innovator, an entrepreneur or a extremely successful business man. For society to function there needs to be individuals who are happy to live average run of the mill lives within their comfort zones. This approach to life should not be looked down upon and only further justifies the notion that risk and failure is uncomfortable and it is those that are willing to risk the most reap the largest rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn conclusion it can be seen that within society those who take the largest risk also experience the greatest successes. Given they are willing to learn from the failures they experience along the way. And as individuals in order to learn, we must first make mistakes as in the words of T.S. Eliot “Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far they can go”   \u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:46:15.306Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T03:23:41.790Z","essay_id":14,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-65337","activation_date":"2016-06-23","expiry_date":"2016-10-08","time_submited":"2016-10-08T01:20:47.493Z","elapsed_time":14755,"status":"marked","course_id":134},{"id":35,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe kingdom of childhood\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nChildhood, the universal term used to define a time period before an individual experiences puberty or becomes of legal age. When I reflect upon the term childhood certain words spring to mind; infancy, youth, toddler, messy, annoying, dependent, toys, family holidays and birthday parties. When gazing over these words as a legal Adult, it makes me question the notion of childhood defined by an age bracket. I still possess many of these traits myself. Does that make me a child? I believe childhood cannot be defined by a time period. Childhood never dies, the toys just get more expensive and the term childhood is disguised by the term adulthood.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt would be naive to think that once we turn a certain age we no longer display the traits of a child. On my journey through childhood to the individual that writes this today, I have had many life experiences, traveled many places the world has to offer, and experienced both triumphs and tragedies.  Yet many aspects of my life remain the same as they did so many years ago when I used to sit and play in the backyard of our family home.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nAs a young girl, I loved to play adventure games in the backyard with my younger brother. We would run wild through the backyard imagining we were explorer’s, pretended to be mountaineers, and dream of becoming professional surfers. Our imaginations would run wild. As I transitioned into adulthood, I continued this passion for adventure. The running through the backyard turned into running through the Indonesian forests. Exploring the differing culture’s, the world has to offer. Pretending to be mountaineers transitioned into a passion for skiing and pretending to be professional surfers, developed into an ever-lasting love for the ocean. My toys changed from cubby houses to swags, pretend aeroplanes to endless flights and foamy surfboards to expensive surfboards. Yet the feelings and emotions experienced remained and felt the same as they did many years ago running through the backyard. The passion was never lost. My childhood never ceased to exist. It is continued through the passion for life I developed in my early years.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nAs a child, like all children I was dependent on my parents for survival, for love, nurture, and comfort. This dependence on our parents I don’t believe can ever be lost. At times it may weaken, and the time in-between contact may grow further and further apart. However, personally when I am faced with adversity and hardship no matter how long it’s been in-between phone calls my parents will be the first people I seek advice from. To this day, while my dependence for survival experienced in what society defines as childhood has changed. The overall trait of dependence stays strong. I still rely on my parents to comfort me, love me and nurture me. This childhood trait will never be lost the older I grow.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nAs we age, we may think our childhood ceases to exist. We may not be considered a child by definition. Nonetheless, as adults, we still display many identical traits that are associated with childhood. We simply replace our childish toys with expensive more practical toys. Our inner child is survived in our values and ideologies that have been shaped by childhood. Childhood cannot be lost it is merely disguised by the term adulthood.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:46:15.316Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T13:42:24.730Z","essay_id":12,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-15464","activation_date":"2016-06-23","expiry_date":"2016-11-08","time_submited":"2016-11-07T04:44:54.247Z","elapsed_time":3636302,"status":"marked","course_id":134},{"id":31,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eAre all men created equal? \u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nWithout laws individuals are free to do as they please; steal, extort, speed, drive whilst under the influence of drugs and alcohol, assault individuals, rape and murder. These behaviors cause individuals and groups in society emotional and physical pain. For society to function effectively and efficiently there must be laws, however as highlighted by Ignazio Silone in his statement “An earthquake achieves what the law promises but does not in practice maintain – the equality of all men” Not all individuals are treated the same in the legal system with power, money, stereotyping and minority groups all heavily influencing the way in which the law is enforced. And thus the ways in which individuals abide to those laws.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n Money and power are significant contributors to the corruption in today’s legal system globally that leads to men not all being treated equally. The more money the individual has the better representation he can acquire. Australia’s top lawyers charge up to $500 per hour, it can be assumed that on average the more competent the lawyer the more they will charge. This further creates a gap in equality between individuals who have committed the same crime, as the better representation the higher chance of a better outcome for the individual. For example Kate Meckler a well off NYC real estate agent was caught stealing $1500 worth of items from sacks and only received five days community service. Most individuals would have received fines and longer periods of community service for this level of crime.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt is important to note that whilst commonly money and power influence the outcome of the law in more serious offences such as murder this is not always the case which shows that sometimes individuals no matter their social status are treated equal, For example John Du Pont of the influential Du Pont family was charged and convicted to life in prison for murdering a colleague in cold blood.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nFurthermore the notion of stereotyping has a role when it comes to the laws not providing equality for all men, particularly in America with the divide between black and white.  As African Americans have been stereotyped to commit dangerous and violent crimes they suffer at the hands of the law. An example of this was the controversial killing of a young unarmed African American teenager who was wrongly shot 16 times and killed by a police officer. How many white unarmed American teenagers have been shot and killed by police? Another example of inequality of men is seen in Australian society in the Gay and Lesbian community simply due to ones sexual preference they are unable to marry their life partner like a straight man and women further highlighting the discrimination of the law within society.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn conclusion it can be argued that whilst society is underpinned by a set of rules and regulations there are significant influences within society that allow individuals to be treated differently. These influences often disadvantage the poorest of individuals in society which keeps fueling the gap within society, cementing the statement by Silone that the law does not treat all men equal. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:46:15.274Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:53.994Z","essay_id":9,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-92675","activation_date":"2016-06-23","expiry_date":"2016-07-07","time_submited":"2016-07-04T07:47:37.780Z","elapsed_time":114175,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":582,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eNightmare \u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nAs I lay in bed, looking up at the dark celling I take a deep breath. I pray, I pray that the dreams do not come back. Not tonight, I can’t handle another nightmare. As I lay silently I fighting to keep my eyes open. I hear the whispers…. “I am sorry, it’s such a shame to have that happen to your family. I can’t fight the sleep creeping through my body. I drift off with the whispers of shame.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIts 4pm I am driving home from work, my phone rings. I can hardly understand my mother on the phone. She is drunk again, shameless about her actions. I have tried to make her realise what she is doing is hurting the ones she loves most. But I have come to the conclusion, you cannot force shame onto someone, they must first feel it themselves before they will change their behaviour.  It’s a shame in its self, but I just have to let it go. I arrive home she is lying on the couch. I’ve had enough as I walk down the stairs.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nScreaming and screeching from my sisters pierces my ears, blood curdling screams are travelling through the house drowning out the sirens from the road below. I run up the stairs and that’s when I see her. I see her falling. There is nothing I can do. I stand frozen in the moment trapped by a dark cloud. The image replays in my mind over the screams. I see my mother jumping out of out three story house onto the floor below. And then the cloud hits me again, the overwhelming feeling of shame. How could I have stopped this? How could I have fixed this? Why has this happened? What will everyone think?\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe next few minutes feel like hours. All I can hear are the screams. Everyone is running. I pick up the phone and dial 000. I am frozen again, how do I tell the operator what happened?. There is such a societal stigma surrounding mental health. I feel embarrassed, ashamed. Is she dead? Is she breathing ? I cannot tell. Again my body begins to freeze the dark cloud not allowing me to move. As she is rushed to hospital the image of her falling is on repeat in my head. I cannot shake it.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe next couple of days are a blur. Family and friends come to visit. It has been a broken record on repeat, stuck on the lyrics: “Its such a shame for your family, for your mother to have this happen”. That’s it! Rage shoots up from my toes engulfing my body. I can’t control it. I scream: “This is the situation, it happened, you cannot fix it. BUT ITS NOT A SHAME. Shame does not come from what life throws at us. SHAME IS HOW YOU FEEL IF YOU HAVE DONE SOMTHIG WRONG”.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nSuddenly I wake up, in a sweat with a loud thump as I fall onto the floor. “That’s it” I scream! I should not be feeling this dark cloud of shame. The same cloud I feel in my nightmare. The same nightmare I have every night that I try to fight. It had finally dawned on me you cannot feel shame for the circumstances you are in. Shame is what keeps us from doing wrong. And I had done nothing wrong. It was in that moment that the dark cloud lifted off my shoulders. Acceptance. And for the first time since my nightmares began, I was not afraid of the dark cloud. I was not afraid to fall asleep. And just like that I drifted back off to sleep with no whispers of shame. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-08-02T10:33:18.969Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T12:49:31.203Z","essay_id":16,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-36751","activation_date":"2016-08-02","expiry_date":"2016-10-18","time_submited":"2016-10-14T05:11:14.157Z","elapsed_time":34503,"status":"marked","course_id":134},{"id":585,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-08-02T10:33:19.002Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:54.832Z","essay_id":19,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-50031","activation_date":"2016-08-02","expiry_date":"2016-12-05","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":586,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-08-02T10:33:19.013Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:54.840Z","essay_id":20,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-25485","activation_date":"2016-08-02","expiry_date":"2016-12-21","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":587,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-08-02T10:33:19.025Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:54.848Z","essay_id":21,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-83366","activation_date":"2016-08-02","expiry_date":"2017-01-06","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":588,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-08-02T10:33:19.036Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:54.856Z","essay_id":22,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-38267","activation_date":"2016-08-02","expiry_date":"2017-01-22","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":589,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-08-02T10:33:19.048Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:54.863Z","essay_id":23,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-61878","activation_date":"2016-08-02","expiry_date":"2017-02-07","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":590,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-08-02T10:33:19.060Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:54.871Z","essay_id":24,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-19221","activation_date":"2016-08-02","expiry_date":"2017-02-23","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":583,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo read or not to read? that is the question. Books break down barriers between countries and cultures. They are written in every language and the first books date back before christ. Books explore the worlds culture and rich history. They spark higher order thinking and foster deep understanding and knowledge. As books hold such powers it is critical that as a society place we place high educational importance on them. This response will argue that books are an extremely important educational tool. However having access to books alone is not sufficient. No educational advantage is gamed if we do not read and incorporate them in the educational system effectively. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nEducational research shows that reading, listing and looking at books is pivotal to early childhood development. From birth our brain is continually developing. Research by the Australian Educational Society has shown that our brain \"maps\" are in a crucial development stage in early childhood. Early exposure to books helps strengthen the connections of the brain and increases academic aptitude. For example infants and toddlers who are exposed to listening to their parents/carers read books are more likely to show higher levels of academic success and understanding when staring kindergarten. Similarly those individuals who learn to read, and continue to read in pre- school often experience a higher level of academic success and read at a higher level compared to other children who have not been exposed to the same level of reading (Board of Studies Teaching and Educational Standards NSW BOSTES). Thus showing the educational importance of books, when integrated effectively.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWithin the education system having access to books is simply not enough to reap the many advantages. Students who choose not to read, gain little knowledge benefits over those individuals within Australia and overseas who are less fortunate and cannot read. Within Australian education reading habits and books but be continually developed and integrated over an individuals schooling career to remain effective. This presents as challenging as every State and Territory is governed by its own standards. However with the development of the National Curriculum has allowed for more effective monitoring and implementation of texts that are both thought provoking and intellectual. With the aim of increasing an individuals academic capacity. Nationwide initiatives such as the premiers reading challenge have also been introduced to give students awards and recognition for reading to help further foster and place importance on books as an educational tool.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhilst books are an integral part of the Australian Education system, and form many fundamentals of academic success. It is important to simply rely on books alone to teach students. Teachers must effectively integrate books along with other resources such as visual aids and ICT activities to cater for the learning styles of all individuals. This ensures books are an effective learning tool that helps shape an individuals education, as there is no \"one fits all\" solution to education. Simply by having a book does not mean it is an effective educational tool. It needs to be implemented effectively to be successful. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOverall it can be seen that books are an extremely important educational tool. They are pivotal to a child's early development and academic aptitude. However to reap the benefits books posses, they must be implemented effectively into education along side other educational practices. As to be able to read but not, is no advantage over the individual who cannot read. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-08-02T10:33:18.980Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T01:49:42.171Z","essay_id":17,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-18861","activation_date":"2016-08-02","expiry_date":"2016-11-03","time_submited":"2016-11-03T00:04:31.617Z","elapsed_time":1697670,"status":"marked","course_id":134},{"id":584,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-08-02T10:33:18.991Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T15:16:55.019Z","essay_id":18,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-90249","activation_date":"2016-08-02","expiry_date":"2016-11-19","time_submited":null,"elapsed_time":0,"status":"unanswered","course_id":134},{"id":32,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eNation of Workaholics\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nDo Australians as a society work to much ? or do we live up to the stereotypical doll bludging, beer drinking, footy short wearing image we have come renowned for? This response will argue that the idea highlighted by Fuller “Men for the sake of living forget to live” does not apply to the Australian society as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn modern day Australia there is the misconception fueled by the media that that as a society we are working too hard. It’s a common excuse when it comes to providing an explanation as to why we are fast approaching “The worlds fattest nation” status. Comments such as “we are working to many hours/ too long to exercise or make healthy meals” commonly thrown around in the media. Further as a nation we make comments that allude to the idea that Australians work to much overtime, we work to late and we never take holidays or time off work. The majority of Australians like to jump on this ban wagon as it makes us as a society feel like we are working hard. However, if you take a close look at the statistics it can be seen that as a nation we are in fact not working long hours and out enjoying life.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) the number of hours worked per week by the average Australian has dropped over the past 30 years, With the average Australian in full time employment working 38 hours a week, the normal minimum requirement for full time employment. From this is can be argued that as a society we are not working as hard as we may think we are and with the number of Australians that can be found on the beaches and in night clubs in summer we are not forgetting to live at all. Furthermore, the ABS highlights that the number of fulltime employees has dropped and the number of part time and casual employees has risen. From this it could be argued that as a nation we are working even less than we used to, all in the name of a good time.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt is important to note that while the average number of hours worked in the nine to five grind has decreased, the ABS statistics show number of hours managers as business owners are working has risen significantly from 38 to 51 hours per week, 13 hours more than their average employee. Are these working picking up the slack for the rest of Australia? Perhaps they are or do they have other motives dominated by money and power that drive them to work longer and harder than the rest of us as they reap the benefits?\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nMoney and power is often a dominating driving factor for younger individuals, as they aim to provide for their families. This is an example were Fullers comment “Men for the sake of living forget to live” rings true. The more money an individual possesses the more they can climb the social status ladder and the more they can provide for their families for example private education, nice cars and big houses. However, these things can only bring so much happiness to individuals. They cannot replace lost time with loved ones, the birthdays they missed and the memories their families made without them, these are gone forever.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn conclusion it can be argued that the typical Australian goes against the common notion created by Australian society that we as a nation are working hard. Statistics clearly show that on average we work the minimum requirement for full time work. And it is the minority of individuals in Australia  driven by ownership, money and power who live to work, not work to live let many of life’s finer moments pass them by.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","user_id":410,"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:46:15.285Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T12:43:14.953Z","essay_id":10,"slug":"charleynolan-iinet-net-87861","activation_date":"2016-06-23","expiry_date":"2016-08-07","time_submited":"2016-08-03T10:42:51.937Z","elapsed_time":544922,"status":"marked","course_id":134},{"id":223,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE

as a species has thrived off warfare through the advancement of technology for use in both warfare and medicine as well as population control, increased resources and expansion of culture and knowledge. The expansion of human knowledge and technology has led to many positive outcomes for the species, however it has also created many undesirable outcomes and consequences. The fall of many civilisations, cultures and beliefs , the weaponisation of technological advancements that could eventuate in our demise and the rise of unstable populist, egotistical and aggressive world leaders and the increasing paranoia of each other will lead humanity down the path of self destruction. Meldrick Lewis states \"If you ain';t never pick up the sword, you ain't never have to worry about fallin' on it\" but could this be the case for humanity?. Have we in essence become executioners of ourselves in a world of conflict?\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe most basic cause of warfare throughout human history has been for the acquisition of resources through the expansion of territorial holdings. In many situations, the resources acquired have been detrimental in determining the survival of the group as a species. This can be seen in the modern world through the eventual extinction of various species caused by the deforestation or acquisition of habitat by humans or the hunting of various animals for the resources they provide. A similar situation befell our neanderthal cousins. Archeological evidence has revealed that a shrinking resource area due to direct competition with Homo sapiens as well as inter species breeding resulted in the eventual extinction of the neanderthalis genus. In an age of empires, resources were diminishing so the Spaniards whom at the time possessed one of the greatest empires of the era, financed explorer Christopher Columbus to travel west in search of a passage to the West Indies to improve trade outcomes but instead found new lands and resources to exploit. The conquest of Aztec Central America and Incan South America by the conquistadores resulting in the destruction of those two civilisations and the natural resources of the area exploited by the invaders. The expansion of Prussian and Russian interests during the Napoleonic era resulted in the annexation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for over a century and Adolf Hitler's living space policy and non-aggression pact with the Russians leading to the exact same outcome. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nExpansion of lands for the benefits of acquiring resources was also usually accompanied by the expansion of culture and beliefs. Accompanied by a paranoia of the different, humanity would wage war on anything that was perceived as different to the status quo whether it be due to skin colour, religion, gender or sexuality. Across history, multiple military tours known as the crusades, were undertaken to retake the Holy Land from \"the barbaric\" islamic people. In the wake of revolutionism in France, the existing Monarchical status quo was uneasy which led to various treaties and economic sanctions that triggered a revitalised France under Napoleon to wage war. The belief of superiority over other races resulted in the kidnapping of many millions of men, women and children from the African continent, South American tribes, Pacific Islands and Aboriginal camps to serve as slaves to an ethnic white civilisation. This same belief also led Adolf Hitler to exterminate many millions of homosexuals, gypsys, disabled peoples and jews during the holocaust in World War 2.  Employing various strategies to convert the masses, Hitler also expanded his brand of fascism in a very poor Germany, addressing issues of the majority and using the minority as scape goats in order to deliver a very populistic message. The Jesuit priests also employed conversion tactics to remove the culture and beliefs of the people of South America, particularly the Guarani people. In the modern era, we are seeing a similar level of paranoia leading to continuing warfare in the Middle East over resources and beliefs. Groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda and a far-right wing element of the Western Nations are boldly declaring holy wars and Jihads against each other. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThrough this warfare, advancements in technology are being made in order for nations to have 'the bigger stick'. The dictator Solano Lopez of Paraguay had the most advanced military of South America at the time it flexed its military might and waged war on a Triple Alliance consisting of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. The most modern weapons and an isolationist approach led Paraguay to become self-reliant and develop both industrial power and military power. The use of chemical weapons inthe European theatre during World War 1, the implementation of aircraft carriers as the dominant naval vessel during the Second World War, the use of the Nuclear Bomb on Hiroshima and the development of propulsion technology by the Nazis all led to positive outcomes such as the Geneva Convention on War conduct, the abolition of Battleships, the creation of more efficient nuclear energy and the development of the space program. However, they all came at a significant human cost. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThrough such a high human cost, advancements of medicine accompanied the development of technology for warfare. The development of Penicillin in time for the World War prevented numerous deaths on the battlefield and gave a significant advantage to the allies. Nazi experimentation with live subjects, although deplorable and immoral, had advanced human understanding of medicine quite significantly. Through medical advancements, the utilisation of disease for warfare was also investigated. Biological warfare tactics were employed by the British through the use of Smallpox to infect the Native Americans.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAlthough warfare has always been used as a means to achieve a positive outcome for the victor, its use as an advancer of human civilisation is debatable. Warfare used for the expansion of lands and resources led to many negative outcomes. The current extinction of species will eventuate in certain species becoming more dominant, certain plants no longer growing due to the role of a certain animal in the digestion of hard seed shells and certain plants becoming extinct due to the overconsumption by dominant species. Despite Neanderthals becoming extinct, mo0dern science has revealed that the inter species breeding has resulted in modern homo sapiens having a Neanderthal gene that causes disease. The Spanish conquest of the New World brought destruction to many civilisations however the resulting influx of wealth in gold resulted in the obliteration of the Spanish economy creating widespread poverty in their empire. The colonies they left in the New World eventually becoming independent but have suffered through decades of instability. Even the annexation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was in effect for nothing as the Polish Republic emerged a century later from a people with an even stronger cultural identity.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAlthough the annihilation of civilisations and beliefs has also led to the destruction of culture and beliefs, expansion of beliefs through warfare has not always been effective. The Crusades did nothing to change the inhabitants of the Holy Land and only brought millions of deaths. A Revolutionary France was eventually followed by a temporary removal of the Monarchy in Spain and an abolition of the Monarchy in Germany, Italy, Romania, Russia, Greece and Egypt. An expansion of a belief of white superiority resulted in millions becoming enslaved but also leading to fights for civil rights and eventual recognition as citizens within dominantly white societies with changed attitudes. The genocide of people in the holocaust particularly the Jewish people had the opposite effect that the Third Reich wanted, eventuating in the establishment of a Jewish state in the Middle East and currently one of the strongest militaries. Even the attempted conversion by the Jesuits resulted in their expulsion from South America, numerous deaths and cultural beliefs lost but also a lot of tradition being retained by the survivors to this day. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWarfare throughout history has ultimately led to very little in terms of land and resource expansion as new technological and medical advancements lead to new resources being identified and required. The act of warfare itself has led to numerous positive outcomes outweighed by mostly negative outcomes on the aggressor. Even in the modern day, the levels of paranoia on the different remains abundant in certain groups and with more powerful weapons at our disposal, we are effectively becoming the cause of our own doom. The biggest benefactors of warfare has been technological and medical advancements however they have been at a high cost and entirely attainable without war. Many human achievements could have been attained through cooperation instead of warfare. Humanity being a selfish creature though, relies on self preservation as an ultimate goal and thus have proven time and time again that they will achieve if it means they will survive.  However, humanity has shown that through this advancement they ahve only created new ways to kill each other effectively becoming the executioners in a world where other species are the victims to our own insatiable greed and lust for power. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","user_id":1090,"created_at":"2016-09-22T00:21:28.058Z","updated_at":"2016-11-22T00:06:04.844Z","essay_id":6,"slug":"woody_111-essay-1-58854","activation_date":"2016-09-22","expiry_date":"2016-11-22","time_submited":"2016-11-22T00:06:04.812Z","elapsed_time":4990805,"status":"unmarked","course_id":41},{"id":1362,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE
