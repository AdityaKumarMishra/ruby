Thanks for this submission. Let’s get cracking:\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction:\u003c/strong\u003e Good work here, there are a lot of good things, namely that you set up your essay up for a great discussion. What would frustrate an examiner here is that you indeed have fantastic intentions and you do a great job of using an appropriate structure (one of the key marking criteria) and your expression is solid throughout \u003cem\u003ehowever\u003c/em\u003e, this – “When these systems that govern us elicit the human lust for power over his fellow man, and when they are allowed to bed for the purposes of a few; our race as a whole is doomed to our own violent instincts. We destroy each other.” – is very ambiguous, tortuous and tough to get through. We need our introduction to be crystal clear and the ambiguity of “human lust”, “purposes of a few”, only touch around what you actually want to say, they fail to say it. Verbs are the biggest part of our language. They give meaning to everything we write and small changes can have massive effects. You need to work on rephrasing what you’ve written here.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eP1:\u003c/strong\u003e The brevity of the introductory sentence is quite good – “Power corrupts all of man” – however, it borders on being \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e short. I know we’ve spoken about clarity but remember that length does not equal confusion, your word selection is what matters. Perhaps it would all read better as:\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDictatorships feed on a hunger for power, which in turn corrupts all men.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\nIt is no longer (in fact shorter) than what you have written, encompasses both points and states them in a clear, short and concise manner. I hope that you can notice the difference. And then – boom! Well done. By introducing your example early, you can use it to bounce between idea-example-idea-example and thus your passage is still engaging (telling the story of the example), but also elucidative of your ideas (important marking criteria). This is an example of high-quality, engaging writing that any examiner will love. As I continue reading, I am magnetically drawn into your story and thus your prose. Comments such as “having no consequence for actions that are normally decreed reprehensible leads to the abundance of such actions”, envelop that notion of the ‘so what’. This passage is incredibly powerful. Especially the back end – “We are violent creatures, and when laws no longer dictate our desires the darkest human characteristic of violence against our fellow man is allowed to flourish. In doing so, our structured order falls to pieces, and chaos reigns.” – what wonderful writing. Well done, Akash.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eP2:\u003c/strong\u003e There’s a large degree of ambiguity here: “If equality of the law is maintained then it does prevent such desires from taking hold for the most part. These laws differ greatly…”. This is what I mean about an idea going on in your head but not being written to an extent that makes it easy to understand. What laws do you mean? The laws in the previous passage? The laws that would be ‘equality’-boosting? Specific laws not mentioned? “These laws…”, is too ambiguous, as is “to prevent ourselves from ending our own future”. Are you suggesting there will be a crazy Armageddon? Tidy up the accuracy. On the whole however, the passage is again very engaging. I honestly don’t think that your idea and example match in this passage:\r\n\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eIdea; we must retain equality \u003cem\u003ethrough the laws that we legislate\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eExample; the \u003cem\u003epolice\u003c/em\u003e (not the laws) do the wrong thing\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\nYou identify this: “The issue isn't with the laws themselves, it lies with those who enforece them”, but then why would you still write what you wrote in the first 2 sentences? It’s very misleading/confusing to the reader. The secondary idea, that the enforcers take the law into their own minds and rearticulate the laws via their actions is brilliant. However, this is not what you indicated that you would write about.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion:\u003c/strong\u003e Nice job! The overall idea/movement/belief – “If laws are continually contradicted by those in power, our society will eventually destroy itself” – is fantastic. Although, I’m still searching for the evidence of a self-destructive society to which you allude. Perhaps “race” is not the best word choice in that context (mid-paragraph). This big, hum-drum, dramatic culmination of your thoughts – “and will find ourselves living among the very animals we thought we'd left behind; that's if we don't all kill each other first” – works a treat and is exactly what I’ve been trying to get you to do. This is the ‘what’s next’, the ‘so what’ of your argument; great writing.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nOn the whole, a great attempt. Your improvement is making me a very happy marker! Well done, Akash.

I’m Jack, the Humanities tutor and the kind recipient of your essay submission. So, let’s get started:\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIntroduction: First of all – great ideas. You synthesise good meaning from not much and this is a very encouraging trait of your writing; well done.  Be careful with overusing grammar – “creatures; it’s an inpulse that we feel deeply at our core, and as much as we can suppress this dangerous trait, there will always be violence between us as people; over ideals that…” – and as such, try to show that you have good syntactic control. We recommend against using or basing your essay solely upon the prompts. The prompts are to be addressed but not regurgitated, nor become the basis of your entire discussion and the examiner should know which one is informing the essay more or less, thus there is no need to write it out in full. The whole aim is to draw ideas from \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e experiences using the quotes as motivation or inspiration, not address the quotes as if this were a year 12 essay. The technique you have used here does not build your thesis, nor does it explore your ideas. This is distinct to fragmenting – breaking up the quote into little chunks – and inserting it cleverly into the prose, which can be effective.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nP1: This, “Since the beginning of the modern age violence has defined the past and shaped the future of our race”, is what I’m talking about! Great stuff. Do you see the difference in this comment from the first of the essay? This sentence is organic; it comes from you. Again, a grammatical note – “…of two world-encompassing wars… each year and…”. What we want to do is to be as clear as possible. In this comment, “we are all fed on”, I find myself asking, ‘fed on \u003cem\u003eby whom\u003c/em\u003e?” Perhaps you need to elaborate here. The ideas are perfect here – short little bullet-points. Ideally though, we’d have one strong, elaborated example attached to the central idea of the passage rather than lots of little ones.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nP2: I really like this appeal to the common sense and communion of the world – “We all know that violence is wrong…”. The inclusivity of using subjects such as ‘we’, and ‘us’, are invaluable to the milieu of your prose. However, this passage is too short though. Each of our paragraphs should be a unique idea and because that idea exists in your head, you need to give yourself enough time to fully explain it to me on the paper. Thus, having only several sentences doesn’t give you that opportunity. As the examiner, I’m scratching my head… ‘does this student have control over how much they write in each of their passages? Have they planned well? Have they used their time effectively?’ Moreover, all that I want to do is hear more about your wonderful ideas – give me more to read!\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nP3: Absolutely lovely tone, as the rest of the essay exudes as well. Again, the inclusivity of your writing is a hallmark – “As noble as it may be to suggest we can live in a world without violence, the fact is we need it.” So, great job using examples here but all the you have done is list them, rather than explaining them – work on this in the future. As yourself the ‘so what’ question. For example, if “Even this year ISIS now pose a threat that cannot simply be negotiated with”, then; so what? What’s the sequelae? Why does it matter?\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nConclusion: I love the inquisitive tone of this conclusion – the shattering of walls and elucidative ideas; “seem unacceptable; “Violence is never the answer”, “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind”. They are optimistic thoughts. The truth is,…”. You do not need to change \u003cem\u003ehow \u003c/em\u003eyou write, so that’s a real positive out of this attempt. Be direct rather than referring to what you’ve previously written in yoru essay. “That concept”, is not an effective way of communicating an idea, sadly. It’d be very time-efficient if it was though!\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nOverall: A good first effort, Akash. I think that there’s a lot to work on in regards to the elaboration of your thoughts though. Think of it like this – there are a million ideas buzzing through your head when you think of ‘violence’, yes? \u003cem\u003eYou\u003c/em\u003e know what they are but does the examiner? Of course not. So, you need to adequately explain yourself so that your ideas become crystal clear to the examiner. Other than that, there are a lot of strengths to this essay and you should be proud of how eloquent your writing is.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","rating":"58.0","essay_response_id":401,"created_at":"2016-08-05T08:11:06.507Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T08:11:06.507Z","staff_profile_id":17,"elapsed_time":0},{"id":15,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003cp\u003eHey again Akash, thanks for the feedback on the last essay and most importantly, the new submission! What a great pace and workrate you’re setting for yourself. Okay, let’s get cracking:\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nIntro: I like where you’ve gone with this introduction; it exudes a certain level of clarity that wasn’t absolutely present the last time. My question for you now is – ‘so what?’ Akin to the feedback in the last essay’s conclusion, I ask you ‘what is your overarching idea, here?’ Yes, these – “small anxieties that plague our thoughts constantly. Some people hide them well, others don't, but we all have them. Our inner thoughts dictate our lives. They can motivate us to our highest accomplishments, and bring us screaming back down to the lowest depths of our lives just as easily” – are all wonderful comments. You need to tell the examiner to what they add up. For example, if you say that education is good because of 1 and 2, and bad because of 3 – you can’t leave the conversation hanging there. We need to usher as to what is the \u003cstrong\u003eoverall\u003c/strong\u003e magnitude/classification of our thoughts. On the plus side, You really set your essay up for a good discussion through appropriate structure\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nP1: Well done for using a personal anecdote, they aren’t always easy to pull off but you do quite a good job here. The one criticism I have about it is the same criticism I have for most of them – it drags on and is too mysterious. This piece is in essay format, so you need to ensure that you still employ these kinds of stories in the ‘evidence’ style. This – “one and lived happily for a time. A time that lasted until he allowed his fears and doubts that only occupied his imagination to become reality. He couldn't find work, so he gave up trying. He tried to write a book, but gave up after the first chapter” – could be far more concise because immediately afterwards – “The fear of failure” – you delve into the personal issues that are going to form the important aspects of this essay. Then from there, your writing flowers beautifully – “Faced with our lowest moments… try to regain control… your won thoughts, they form you.” On the whole, you save the vagueness of the anecdote to some extent but the examiner wants more of the ‘good stuff’ that I’m alluding too above. Capiche? It’s all well and good to tell a story in the essay, in fact it’s a very good ploy, but you need to ensure that you don’t sacrifice yourself the chance to allow your ideas to blossom as a result. From “they form you”, I want to read more about what \u003cstrong\u003eyou think\u003c/strong\u003e, not what your father has done.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nP2: As this passage rolls from the first, I’ll let my feedback do the same. This comment, “I know I have these thoughts constantly, and I face them head on as much as I can”, is too vague. What thoughts? What failures specifically? Describe them? How do they make you feel? What emotions do they evoke? You mention ‘anxieties’ in your introduction and on the whole, I’m still waiting for you to describe them. Sure, “I berate myself”, is descriptive but does it tell the examiner that the feelings of anxiety, stress and self-rejection leave us looking further and further outside of ourselves for motivation and success. We neglect our sense of self because the sickening feeling of becoming someone else distracts us from what we should really be doing – being ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\r\nSee, the difference between that bit of writing and what your essay poses is that your essay is very superficial in the way that it \u003cstrong\u003eidentifies\u003c/strong\u003e but does not \u003cstrong\u003edig beneath the surface.\u003c/strong\u003e Consider this for next time.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\nConclusion: the bad stuff first – this is the same length as the body paragraphs; not a good sign. Remember that the best students draw examples and evidence from outside their personal experience as generally, your ideas transmit enough of ‘you’ into the essay. If you get writer's block, the best thing to do is to revert back to telling the story of the example. Not only are these examples usually more engaging and unique but they relate your thoughts to those actions/beliefs of someone in the broader community. Your writing should be done by the time you get to the conclusion (the cake should be baked, to use a metaphor), and all that you have to do is ice the work that you’ve already done. Now, the good: vocab, structure and eloquence is delightful. The inclusivity that we spoke about last time is a focal point and any examiner would enjoy the proposition that “we have to be content with these thoughts” – we can all sense a degree of reserved relief about that fact. This is a very nice ‘\u003cstrong\u003eoverall\u003c/strong\u003e’ idea that I elude to in the introduction.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nSome things to think about: try to type the essays in the submission window, so that I can track how long you’re taking for a given essay. If not, just write “time: x minutes, y seconds”, at the end of the piece. I \u003cstrong\u003elove\u003c/strong\u003e the two-paragraph style, this is how I wrote in the GAMSAT and believe me, it pays off. Keep diving deeper – ask yourself/the virtual version of me, ‘what next? What is the next idea? If this idea is true, what does it mean for society/humanity?’ Finally, I’ll leave you with this; if your ‘idea’ is that “[fears, thoughts and anxieties] will drive us to become all that we are fearful of being”, what’s the outcome of that? What’s the end result? The answer to \u003cem\u003ethis \u003c/em\u003equestion is what will get you marks. Be a student, a learner, a human who can consider the \u003cu\u003edeeper\u003c/u\u003e level of your existence. If we all turn out to be the monsters that we fear becoming – \u003cstrong\u003eso what?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","rating":"58.0","essay_response_id":402,"created_at":"2016-08-10T06:57:10.019Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T06:57:10.019Z","staff_profile_id":17,"elapsed_time":0},{"id":61,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey Akash, good to hear from you. Well done on this submission, please see the blow-by-blow feedback attached below.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003ePlan:\u003c/strong\u003e Type out a plan for me next time. It is quintessentially the most important element of how your piece takes shape and thus, it’s critical that you practice it. Even if it’s in dot-point form, make sure that you do it. You will come up with your own method over time and you’ll be one step closer to nailing the GAMSAT. I will keep hammering this home until your eyes are sore of reading it if you don’t, so you may as well get into the habit of doing so quickly!\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction: \u003c/strong\u003eOn the whole; catchy, well-written but misguided. It’s rather informal considering the rest of the piece is a formal essay. Throughout your writing, consider the object and subsequent tone deduced from how you frame your ideas. For example, do you want to be isolating and stand-alone, “you”, “people”, or do you want to be inclusive and involved, “we”, “us”? There’s nothing ‘wrong’ with adopting the second-person, direct tone to your writing, but given that you’re \u003cem\u003ecritiquing\u003c/em\u003e someone’s thought process, I feel quite annoyed by the way that you’re interrogating \u003cstrong\u003eme\u003c/strong\u003e in your introduction. In a previous submission, I remember commenting on the fact that you need to answer the ‘so what’ question – why do my ideas matter? This should be the last sentence of your intro.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eP1: \u003c/strong\u003eGood work here with the idea-example pairings, it makes your writing flow a good deal. However, it’s best not to start with an example – “Steve Jobs” – in this case. Your piece is not about regurgitating facts, it is about synthesising \u003cem\u003eideas\u003c/em\u003e, your ideas! Again, this tone – “Ask anyone what they really, deep down desire to pursue as a career and the chances are they won’t say whatever field they’re currently in (or they'll lie)” – makes me feel uncomfortable. Why are you angry \u003cem\u003eat me\u003c/em\u003e? Look at how you direct your arguments. From then on however, you make a nice recovery, flickering to the universal – “we’re afraid…”. Good job, here. But then, it plummets – “What if I fail?” \u003cstrong\u003eWho are you writing this piece for, Akash?\u003c/strong\u003e It is so confused it’s making my head spin. Overall, a nice idea that is perhaps lost in a bit of tonal detriment. Ask yourself: who am I writing for? Does this essay need to be direct and contain ideas, or does it need to question and waft things out into the air for the examiner to decide? If you choose the second, we need to reconsider! The examiner is examining your thoughts, not trying to make up their own.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eP2: \u003c/strong\u003eAgain, I commend you on a great example, my friend. However, as you’ve just discovered – it needs to come \u003cem\u003eafter\u003c/em\u003e you introduce your idea. Of the first three sentences, the majority is quoted material. This is not good enough for the GAMSAT. The game is originality and rolling the dice with plagiarised thoughts will only result in a loss. This passage is better – “My mother used to always say “imagine if I hadn’t had you kids, what I’d be achieving right now”.” – in which you reflect on \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e experiences for almost the first time in the essay. I’m not sure about your message. It seems that you’re saying \u003cem\u003eexcuses shouldn’t matter, \u003c/em\u003eyet only when “[your] sister and [yourself] moved out”, did “[your] mother [achieve] extraordinary things”, which seems to be literally the opposite. Perhaps try re-writing this section. The passage terminates well – “Passion is what drives us as a race to achieve things that were once never possible, with all else being inconsequential.” – a phrase that I really enjoyed reading.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion: \u003c/strong\u003ePay attention to grammar; “Everyone can achieve great \u003cu\u003ethings; most\u003c/u\u003e don’t.” The conclusion is totally different to the confused, questioning nature of the essay proper. However, I feel so confronted, not roused by the way in which you address your reader. What if the examiner is an 80 year-old ex-English teacher that has achieved her hopes and dreams? What about the really young and the really old, or even the middle age? Who are you addressing? I’m intrigued by this: “So go out, and follow your passion, \u003cstrong\u003eand with some luck\u003c/strong\u003e, that regret will never find you.” So, is luck the most important element of success? Where was this shown in the essay? It’s not akin to excuses, nor regret. I’m not sure that this can be your landmark statement if you haven’t spoken about it.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eFinal comments:\u003c/strong\u003e The extra breadth you give yourself to explain your ideas, particularly in the second passage, is wonderful.

However, it is important that you understand the rules of using semi-colons as inappropriate use has the opposite effect. I would also suggest revising the correct use of “its” vs. “it’s” and the variations of “they, they’re, there, their, these, those”.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eStructure\u003c/strong\u003e (59):\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis criterion relates to how well you have set out your essay to make a structured argument or tell a story. You have written in a consistent style which helped you to make your points effectively. Your introduction was of a good length and provided and appropriate outline of the key points for your argument; your conclusion was a good summary of what you had written however added little to what you had already said. You acknowledged that there was a negative side to fame but decided to focus on the positives, which you did well. As a reader I felt your argument lacked progression of ideas, it was much the same thing reiterated through different examples, which therefore made it difficult for you to add anything extra in your conclusion. A paragraph discussing the negative side of fame would have helped to add some depth and progression to your essay, and would have enabled you to make a definitive decision in your conclusion.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eContent \u003c/strong\u003e(61):\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYou easily identified a relevant theme and followed it throughout your essay.

The main issue with it is that there are a number of punctuation and grammatical errors that prevent it from being the strong opening it should be. For example, you wrote, \"History can be defined as the study of past events, as a modern society in a technologically advance world, we as individuals have vast access to the past and present and are able to make our own judgements on historical events.\" This is not one sentence, but is rather two, and should have been written like this - \"History can be defined as the study of past events. As a modern society in a technologically advance world, we as individuals have vast access to the past and present and are able to make our own judgements on historical events.\" I like how you opened with defining exactly what \"history\" meant in the context of this essay - it sets the foundation of the piece, and is a powerful way to open. Also, I worry that in this essay you're attempting to prove two separate hypotheses - namely, that history is subjective AND that history is concerned more with the deeds of evil people than good people. I think in order to make your essay convincing, you really needed to have chosen ONE of these point, and explored it in greater detail. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour first paragraph is good in that it raises a single argument, however it doesn't explore it in much detail. Your topic sentence could be a little stronger, and you needed to go in to much more depth of your analysis and exploration of the point it raised. Also, I would advise against using Nazi Germany as an example in your GAMSAT essays - so many people do, and it is a little cliche and simplistic. There are plenty more interesting example you can draw upon, so use those instead! It will capture your readers attention a little more and show that you've thought about the topic in a little more depth. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour second paragraph raises an interesting point, however it doesn't really explore the arguments it's making. You wrote, \"Further there is often no set facts or visual evidence throughout our past, this leaves significant room for interpretation. Additionally, Historians are not machines they are individuals with emotions, so there can be no guarantee that due to their own past they can interpret facts in a completely objective manner.  Thus showing how history is a mere interpretation of facts.\" These are two interesting points that you have just thrown away in single sentences - they each could really be explored in a paragraph each. It was good, however, how you gave the example of the Vietnam War to support this paragraph's first point. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour third paragraph is good in that it attempts to serve as an antithesis to your main arguments, however it isn't detailed or thorough enough. It really is just stating facts, like that Einstein came up with the Theory of Relativity. How are you relating this back to the topic? Perhaps you could have argued something along the lines of, \"Whilst indeed history does acknowledge the good deeds done by people in the past, the overwhelmingly focuses upon the evil deeds done by those with no care of concern for humanity.\" Do you see how this is actually making a point, rather than just saying, \"History tells us that Thomas Edison invented the light bulb\"? \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOverall, this essay raises some great points, perhaps TOO many. I would suggest that in future you try to focus on ONE main hypothesis. For example, in this essay you could have only argued that \"History is subjective,\" then used the excellent points you raised in your second paragraph as topic sentences for your paragraphs and explored each of them in detail with a relevant example. Does this make sense? When you try to argue two unrelated central arguments your essay reads as a little confusing and disjointed. Also, just go back and review your grammar, spelling and punctuation. There were a few times in this piece where your grammatical errors made it difficult to glean exactly what it was you were trying to say. Your use of examples, though, was great in that they were relevant to your arguments and, in the case of the Vietnam War one, different to what people normally write about. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nI hope all this helps.

This piece makes some really great points and was enjoyable and easy to read. Well done! \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe introduction is clear and introduces your first main point - that is, that without risk we cannot learn. Your second point, however - that not everyone can behave in such a manner or else society would not function - isn't touched upon in the introduction. This is a shame, as it is an interesting idea. Also, in your introduction you wrote this: \"As it is the failures and consequences of risk that broaden our knowledge base, provoke and stimulate learning and change us as individuals in a positive manner. Without mistakes humans cannot simply learn.\" This doesn't make sense, and it seems a comma should be placed between these two sentences rather than a full stop. Just be careful to avoid grammar mistakes like this, as they can sometimes make your piece more difficult to read. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour first paragraph makes a really interesting point. The example you use is also really interesting and surprising - it's good to have unexpected examples, as it makes your piece more engaging to read. It is a little too detailed, however - the example here forms the bulk of the paragraph. Examples should only be used to \u003cem\u003esupport \u003c/em\u003ethe point your paragraph is trying to make, not be the main focus of the paragraph as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour second paragraph is good in that it attempts to be an antithesis to your piece's main argument. This is important, as it shows you have considered your topic from a variety of perspectives. I feel this paragraph needs to be a little more detailed, however, to give it weight and make it more convincing. Likewise, I think it also needs an example to make it more understandable. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOverall, this piece makes a valid argument that just needs to be broken down into smaller sections and argued more thoroughly. Likewise, your antithesis needs to be developed a little more so that it actually counters your hypothesis. Your Dyson example was a little too detailed, however it was fascinating and really interesting to read. For next time, try to make sure that your paragraphs develop the argument they are trying to make a little more before introducing the example. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nKeep up the great work, and as always feel free to ask me any questions you have! =)\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTay. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","rating":"63.0","essay_response_id":34,"created_at":"2016-10-10T03:23:39.329Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T03:23:39.329Z","staff_profile_id":202,"elapsed_time":751323},{"id":99,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003cp\u003eHey Charley, \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nSorry about the delay in marking this one! \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nI found this a really moving and emotionally engaging piece. You've really followed on from the themes of childhood raised in the provided quotes, and have crafted a thoughtful response to them. Well done! \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nLike some of your other pieces, however, the main issue with this piece is its structure. Not to worry, though - it's definitely getting better with each piece of yours that I read. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nSo, for example, I really like your central thesis that we don't ever stop being children. It's an interesting view and one worth exploring. Given that it's your central thesis, I would put it straight up in your first sentence. No mucking around. Just put out there what it is you want to say. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour first paragraph isn't really a paragraph - it's more just a re-explanation of your central hypothesis. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOn to your individual paragraphs. As I've said before, the topic sentences of each of your paragraphs should relate directly back to your central hypothesis. So, if we say your hypothesis is \"We never stop being children\" then it would make sense for your first paragraph's topic sentence to be, \"The toys we play with in childhood aren't lost but are replaced.\" You could then go on to include what you discuss here, which is all pretty good. Do you see how that topic sentence relates back to your central hypothesis better? The topic sentence follows on directly from your hypothesis. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nLikewise, the topic sentence of your second paragraph needs tweaking also, perhaps to something like, \"Even as adults, we still have a child-like need for our parents.\" Again, can you see how this relates more strongly to your thesis, \"We never stop being children\"? \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour piece would also have benefited from a paragraph that forms an antithesis to your argument. Perhaps something like, \"Modern society forces us to stop being children\" but then synthesised this with your thesis by saying something like, \"No matter how hard it tries, however, our inner child remains strong as can be seen in...\" Do you see how this raises a point against your thesis, but then rectifies this difference and synthesis the two points? \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAlso, I would recommend you have a look at your individual paragraph structure again, bearing in mind the TEEL paragraph plan I've discussed before (Topic sentence, Explanation, Evidence/Example, Linking Sentence). Whilst your paragraphs do feature each of these sections, it would be good if you could make them clearer and more distinct, perhaps through the use of signposting. So, for example, when you are moving on to the example part of your paragraphs, literally write \"For example...\" Or, when writing the explanation part, begin it with, \"That is...\" to signal you are explaining your topic sentence clearer. Signposting words such as this can help your reader understand where you're going, and makes it easier for them to track your argument (be careful, though - if you signpost TOO much then your essay is dull to read. It's a fine line, but no one ever said essay writing was a science!) \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour conclusion is good here, although it is missing a point at the end that resolves it. Perhaps something like, \"Perhaps by learning to embrace this inner child, rather than trying to repress it, we will become happier, more fulfilled, more joyful people.\" Do you see how this point is just a nice concluding remark that shows you have considered the implications of what your essay has said? It's nice to have lines like this at the end of your essay - it shows that you have taken on board what you have said, and have thought about the implications of it in the real world. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOverall, however, this essay is a very nice reflective piece. Its mood is appropriately emotive and reflective, and you make some interesting points. Again, just by tweaking your structure a little bit your interesting thoughts will be able to be much clearer to the reader and your arguments will become more convincing. Don't fear, though - I can definitely see progress in the structure of your essays happening! Keep at it - it's the hardest part, but once you've mastered it you're set. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAs always, let me know if you have any questions. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTay. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nP.S.

I found your piece a really enjoyable and emotionally engaging read, so thank you! \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFirst of all, you do a terrific job of keeping your piece on topic. Most creative responses tend to be stories that are only slightly related to the theme supplied, but your piece actively engages with the concept of \"shame\" a number of times in a number of different ways. I think it's great that in each paragraph you focus on a different kind of shame - it means that your piece has movement, and isn't just a long explanation of the one concept. Great work! \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour fifth paragraph is particularly good. You arrive at an interesting and thought-provoking conclusion that is well considered and justified by the rest of the piece. This is so important for a creative piece - that it actually \u003cem\u003esays \u003c/em\u003esomething. Well done! \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe one major issues with this piece is in its interpretation of its central line - \"It's such a shame to have that happen to your family.\" In this sentence, the word \"shame\" isn't really used to mean \"shame\" like you explore in the essay, it's more to express the notion of \"it's disappointing that...\" Do you see the difference? Perhaps it could be re-worded such that it leads more naturally on to the point you are trying to make. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThere are a number of spelling and grammatical errors in this piece. For example, in the opening paragraph you write, \"I hear the whispers…. “I am sorry, it’s such a shame to have that happen to your family. I can’t fight the sleep creeping through my body. I drift off with the whispers of shame.\" There isn't another set of quotations marks, however, to denote when the quote you write has finished. This makes the opening a little confusing to read, as the reader has to guess where the quote ends. Likewise, in your second paragraph you wrote, \" It’s a shame in its self, but I just have to let it go.\" The word \"itself\" is one word, however, not two as you wrote. There are a few other errors in the rest of the piece. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOverall, however, for a creative piece this essay responds extremely well to the theme provided and engages with it in a number of interesting and varied ways. Apart from the problem with misinterpretation of the word \"shame\" as described above and the grammatical/spelling mistakes throughout, it is an extremely engaging and thought-provoking piece. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nCongratulations! Creative pieces are rarely so insightful and relevant to the prompts supplied. Just make sure you allow a little bit of time at the end of your writing time to go back and proofread your work - it's a shame when a thoughtful piece such as this is a little difficult to read due to simple, easily-fixed errors. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWell done! \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTay. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","rating":"65.0","essay_response_id":582,"created_at":"2016-10-17T12:49:28.692Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T12:49:28.692Z","staff_profile_id":202,"elapsed_time":1600689},{"id":83,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003cp\u003eHi Charley, \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThanks again for another submission =)\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis essay is a good attempt at responding to the prompts provided, however its overall structure is disappointing and means that the interesting points you raise aren't as convincing as they could be. For example, your second and third paragraphs are essentially saying the same thing, which isn't ideal. Let me take you through how I would have structured your essay using your key points: \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nSo, to begin with, the central hypothesis of the essay could have been something like, \"Books and the act of reading are central to human development.\" \u003cbr\u003e\r\nThen, the first paragraph could have been about how reading is important for neural development (like your first paragraph here, is). The topic sentence could have been, \"Books are central to neural development and the maturation of the human brain.\" \u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe second paragraph could have been about how books enable us to access a vast amount of knowledge from across time and disciplines. Its topic sentence could have been, \"Furthermore, books allow us to develop knowledge and awareness pertaining to different facets of the world that enables us to develop into well informed individuals.\" \u003cbr\u003e\r\nThen, the third paragraph could have been an antithesis and could have been about how books alone are not enough, but rather they need to be incorporated into school curriculums (again, like you did in this piece). \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nDoes this plan make sense? Do you see how each of the topic sentences and arguments in the paragraphs relates directly back to the central hypothesis and supports it? By ensuring this is the case the essay that is based on this plan will be a united and coherent whole. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nHaving said this, your piece has many interesting examples and ideas. For example, I think your ideas about how books could be incorporated in schools are really great, as is your knowledge of how reading influences brain development. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThere are a number of grammatical, spelling and punctuation mistakes throughout this piece. Go back through it carefully and try to find where these mistakes are - if you need help identifying them just reply to this feedback and I'll give you a few examples =) \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nI hope all this helps. This piece has really great ideas in it, it just needs to have its structure tweaked a little bit in order to become an excellent piece. Don't worry, though - sorting out the structure of an essay if by far the most difficult part of essay writing that most students struggle with. The good news is, though, that once you've got it down pat your essays will improve and will be much easier to write. 95% of an essay is the structure, so once you nail that you're bound to write a great piece. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nLet me know if you have any questions! =)\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTay. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\n","rating":"60.0","essay_response_id":583,"created_at":"2016-11-04T01:49:39.684Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T01:49:39.684Z","staff_profile_id":202,"elapsed_time":3636681},{"id":46,"response":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003cp\u003eHi Nicolas, \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThanks for your piece. It was a really interesting read that raised some great points! \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo begin with, your introduction is very concise, perhaps a little too concise. Whilst it introduces one main argument your essay makes, it doesn't really introduce any of the other points you raise, which is a shame because they're all quite interesting! I really liked how you started out with questions - this is a great way to grab your reader's attention and immediately lets them know what your piece is going to be about. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour first paragraph raises an interesting point - that Australians do not work as much as we say/think we work. Your topic sentence is clear, however the rest of the structure of the paragraph is lacking a little. Your second paragraph - where you list statistics about working hours of Australians - is terrific, however it really should have been in your first paragraph. All that statistical information would have been great in the example section of the paragraph (using the Topic Sentence, Explanation, Evidence/Example, Linking Sentence paragraph model), rather than as its own separate paragraph. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nLikewise, your third and fourth paragraphs are really making the same point - that a small number of Australians are working MORE than they used to. This is a really interesting point, but I feel again that the structure of your paragraphs means that it's not made as clearly as it could be. Begin with a clear topic sentence, then explain this topic sentence, before moving on to describing your examples and evidence in support of your point. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour conclusion does a good job of summarising your essay's main points. It's succinct and to the point. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOverall, your essay has some good points but the way that you explore them is unorganised and means that they don't come across as clearly as they could. Next time make sure you come up with a detailed essay plan, ensuring your introduction introduces ALL of your key points, and that each paragraph is structured as per the TEEL essay format I described above. Also, there were a number of punctuation errors throughout this piece. Whilst you won't lose marks for this specifically, they do inhibit the clarity of your essay and may draw your examiner's attention away from the point you are trying to make. Always allow time to go back and review your piece clearly, just to make sure that these mistakes don't slip through. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nI hope all this helps!
